242. DRAG DROP - (Topic 2)

A customer recently experienced a power outage at a SOHO. The customer does not think the components are connected properly. A print job continued running for several minutes after the power failed, but the customer was not able to interact with the computer.

Once the UPS stopped beeping, all functioning devices also turned off.

In case of a future power failure, the customer wants to have the most time available to save cloud documents and shut down the computer without losing any data.

INSTRUCTIONS

Based on the customer's requirements, connect the customer's devices to the proper outlets. Select the power source for the Surge Protector and UPS. This may require reselecting dropdowns or removing tokens.

Each token may only be used once.

**Answer:**

See the Explanation and detailed steps below.

Explanation:

Looking at the network configurations and outputs from both PCs and servers, here are the possible issues and solutions:

* 1. PC 1

Issue: The IP address for PC1 is 192.168.1.1, which conflicts with Server 1 (which also uses 192.168.1.1).

Solution: Change the IP address on PC1 to a unique one within the range, like 192.168.1.3.

* 2. PC 2

Issue: PC 2 is configured with 192.168.1.2, which conflicts with Server 2 that has the same IP address.

Solution: Update the IP address on PC 2 to something unique, like 192.168.1.4.

* 3. Server 1

Issue: The IP address for Server 1 is 192.168.1.1, which conflicts with PC1.

Solution: Since Server 1 and PC1 are using the same IP address, change one of them. For Server 1, you could change the IP address to 192.168.1.5.

* 4. Server 2

Issue: Server 2 is using the IP address 192.168.1.2, which conflicts with PC2. Solution: Update Server 2 to use a different IP address, such as 192.168.1.6. General Remediation:

The primary problem here is overlapping IP addresses, leading to connectivity issues. Each device on the network must have a unique IP address. After making these changes, ensure that all devices can communicate properly by testing the connection between devices and verifying they can access shared resources.

Click on Server 1 and Server 2 and review the information presented in each chart to determine which drives need to be replaced.

Select the appropriate replacement drive that should be used, for the least performance degradation to the server.

**Answer:**

See the detailed solution in explanation below.

Explanation:

The degraded status on Server 2 indicates a RAID-5 issue, typically due to a failed or failing drive. In RAID-5 configurations, when one drive fails, the system can still operate but with reduced performance as parity data is used to rebuild missing data on-the-fly. Recommended Replacement Drive:

To minimize performance degradation, the replacement drive should be:

SAS HDD with the same specifications (64KB stripe size, no read-ahead, and write-back policy).

Matching the configuration exactly ensures seamless integration and optimizes recovery speed in the RAID-5 array.

In RAID-5, degraded performance is expected when one drive fails, as parity data needs to rebuild missing information during each read/write process. Replacing the failed drive restores the RAID array to optimal status, reducing the load on existing drives and returning the system to normal read/write performance. The write-back policy and disabled disk cache settings are designed to reduce latency and increase efficiency, essential for handling real-time applications.

A user reports poor performance on the application server.

INSTRUCTIONS

Click on Server 1 and Server 2 and review the information presented in each chart to determine which drives need to be replaced. Select the appropriate replacement drive that should be used, for the least

performance degradation to the server.
