    "question": "A Windows user recently replaced a computer. The user can access the public internet on the computer; however, an internal site at https://companyintranet.com:8888 is no longer loading. Which of the following should a technician adjust to resolve the issue?",
    "options": [
      "A. Default gateway settings",
      "B. DHCP settings",
      "C. IP address settings",
      "D. Firewall settings"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Firewall settings (D) is the correct answer because the firewall may be blocking access to the internal site, especially since it uses a non-standard port (8888). The firewall settings control network traffic filtering and may be preventing access to the internal site by default. Default gateway, DHCP, and IP address settings are less likely to cause this specific issue."

    "question": "A security log shows that data was stolen from a corporate laptop. The log indicates the source IP address 192.168.1.1 sent a file named secrets.zip to destination IP address 192.168.1.50. Which of the following protocols most likely allowed the data theft to occur?",
    "options": [
      "A. 1",
      "B. 53",
      "C. 110",
      "D. 445"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Port 445 (D) is the correct answer because it's used by SMB (Server Message Block) protocol for file sharing. SMB enables access to files and resources on a network, making it the most likely protocol exploited for data theft. Port 1 is not a standard port, port 53 is DNS, and port 110 is POP3 email."

    "question": "The company plans to upgrade from a 32-bit Windows OS to a 64-bit OS. Which of the following will the company be able to fully take advantage of after the upgrade?",
    "options": [
      "A. CPU",
      "B. Hard drive",
      "C. RAM",
      "D. Touch screen"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "RAM (C) is the correct answer because 64-bit operating systems can address more than 4GB of RAM, while 32-bit systems are limited to 4GB. This allows the company to fully utilize larger amounts of memory. CPU, hard drive, and touch screen functionality are not significantly affected by the 32-bit to 64-bit upgrade."

    "question": "A customer installed a new web browser from an unsolicited USB drive that the customer received in the mail. The browser is not working as expected, and internet searches are redirected to another site. Which of the following should the user do next after uninstalling the browser?",
    "options": [
      "A. Delete the browser cookies and history.",
      "B. Reset all browser settings.",
      "C. Change the browser default search engine.",
      "D. Install a trusted browser."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Install a trusted browser (D) is the correct answer because the unsolicited USB drive likely contained malware-infected software. After uninstalling the compromised browser, the user should install a legitimate browser from a trusted source. Deleting cookies, resetting settings, and changing search engines won't address the underlying malware issue."

    "question": "Which of the following data is MOST likely to be regulated?",
    "options": [
      "A. Name in a Phone book",
      "B. Name on a medical diagnosis",
      "C. Name on a job application",
      "D. Name on a employer's website"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Name on a medical diagnosis (B) is the correct answer because medical information is protected by HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) regulations. Medical diagnoses contain sensitive personal health information that requires strict privacy and security controls. Phone book listings, job applications, and employer website names are not typically regulated to the same degree."

    "question": "A user reports a computer is running slow. Which of the following tools will help a technician identify the issue?",
    "options": [
      "A. Disk Cleanup",
      "B. Group Policy Editor",
      "C. Disk Management",
      "D. Resource Monitor"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Resource Monitor (D) is the correct answer because it provides real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. This helps identify which processes or services are consuming system resources and causing the slow performance. Disk Cleanup removes unnecessary files, Group Policy Editor manages system policies, and Disk Management handles storage configuration."

    "question": "Which of the following backup methods only backs up files that have changed since the last backup?",
    "options": [
      "A. Full",
      "B. Mirror",
      "C. Incremental",
      "D. Differential"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Incremental (C) is the correct answer because it only backs up files that have changed since the last backup (whether full or incremental). This saves storage space and bandwidth while retaining multiple backup versions. Full backups copy all files, mirror creates exact copies, and differential backs up changes since the last full backup."

    "question": "Which of the following OS types provides a lightweight option for workstations that need an easy-to-use browser-based interface?",
    "options": [
      "A. FreeBSD",
      "B. Chrome OS",
      "C. macOS",
      "D. Windows"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Chrome OS (B) is the correct answer because it's designed as a lightweight, browser-based operating system. It provides a simple interface focused on web applications and cloud computing. FreeBSD is a server OS, macOS is a full desktop OS, and Windows is a comprehensive desktop OS."

    "question": "A user reports that the pages flash on the screen two or three times before finally staying open when attempting to access banking web pages. Which of the following troubleshooting steps should the technician perform NEXT to resolve the issue?",
    "options": [
      "A. Clear the browser cache and cookies.",
      "B. Disable browser extensions.",
      "C. Update the browser to the latest version.",
      "D. Check for malware infections."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Disable browser extensions (B) is the correct answer because browser extensions can interfere with page loading and cause flashing or flickering issues. Extensions may conflict with banking websites' security features or scripts. Clearing cache, updating browser, and malware checks are secondary troubleshooting steps."
