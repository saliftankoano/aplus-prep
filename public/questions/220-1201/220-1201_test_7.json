    "question": "A customer is able to print most documents with their USB inkjet printer, but the system is unresponsive when printing a certain report from a custom application. Nothing will print until the computer is restarted and the printer is power cycled. A technician remotes into the PC and confirms that the spooler stops working when this report is sent. After cleaning the spooler and reinstalling the drivers from the manufacturer's website, the issue persists. No other sites using the application report similar issues. Which of the following is most likely causing the issue?",
    "options": [
      "A. The manufacturer is curating content before it reaches the device to preserve ink.",
      "B. The application has a bug that the developer needs to address.",
      "C. The system is using the PostScript language instead of the PCL.",
      "D. Personal preferences have changed and documents with graphics are now online-only"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "B (The application has a bug that the developer needs to address.) is the correct answer. Since the issue is isolated to a specific report from a specific custom application and standard troubleshooting (spooler, drivers) has failed, the problem likely lies within the application's code generating the print job incorrectly, crashing the spooler service."

    "question": "A user reports intermittent Wi-Fi issues in an open office. Other users are not affected. What is the most likely cause?",
    "options": [
      "A. Interference from other Wi-Fi signals",
      "B. All users are on the same frequency",
      "C. The laptop's wireless card is malfunctioning",
      "D. The antenna is near a device creating electromagnetic interference"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "C (The laptop's wireless card is malfunctioning) is the correct answer. If interference or frequency congestion were the cause, multiple users in the open office would likely be affected. Since the issue is isolated to a single user, the problem is most likely with that specific user's hardware (wireless NIC or antenna)."

    "options": ["A. Gateway", "B. Static IP", "C. APIPA", "D. DHCP"],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "B (Static IP) is the correct answer. If a printer uses DHCP, it may receive a different IP address after a power outage or lease expiration. This breaks the connection for computers configured to print to the old IP. Assigning a Static IP ensures the printer's address remains permanent."

      "B. Clean the printheads",
      "C. Switch the paper type",
      "D. Change the ribbon"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "B (Clean the printheads) is the correct answer. For inkjet printers, poor print quality (streaks, missing colors, faded text) despite a new cartridge often indicates clogged printhead nozzles. Running the printer's built-in printhead cleaning utility clears dried ink and restores flow."

      "B. Default gateway",
      "C. Subnet mask",
      "D. VLANs"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "B (Default gateway) is the correct answer. The Default Gateway is the path traffic takes to leave the local network (LAN) and reach external networks like the internet. If local resources work (LAN is fine) but internet fails, the firewall update likely blocked or misconfigured the gateway connection."

      "A. DHCP reservation assignment",
      "B. Dynamic assignment",
      "C. Self-assignment",
      "D. Static assignment"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "C (Self-assignment) is the correct answer. An address starting with 169.254.x.x is an APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) address. The OS self-assigns this when it is configured for DHCP but fails to reach a DHCP server, indicating a network connectivity or server issue."

    "options": ["A. TPM", "B. CPU", "C. RAM", "D. HDD"],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "A (TPM) is the correct answer. BitLocker normally requires a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip to encrypt the operating system drive. If the PC lacks a TPM or it is disabled in the BIOS/UEFI, BitLocker encryption will fail (unless a Group Policy workaround for USB startup keys is enabled)."

      "B. Configure PoE on the switch",
      "C. Change the encryption from WPA3 to WPA2",
      "D. Turn on MAC address filtering"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "A (Enable QoS in the router) is the correct answer. Quality of Service (QoS) settings prioritize latency-sensitive traffic (like VoIP voice data) over less urgent traffic (like file downloads or web browsing). Even with good speed, high network congestion can cause jitter and packet loss for VoIP; QoS prevents this."

    "options": ["A. APIPA", "B. Gateway", "C. IP address", "D. Subnet mask"],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "B (Gateway) is the correct answer. (Note: While IP and Subnet mask are also required, the Gateway is strictly necessary to communicate *outside* the local subnet. In the context of \"connecting to the network\" broadly including internet/WAN, Gateway is critical. Often, DHCP handles all three. However, without a Gateway, you are stuck on the LAN.) *Self-correction: The question asks what to configure to connect to the network. Usually, you need IP, Subnet, and Gateway. If manually configuring, all three are needed. If the question implies what allows traffic to leave, it's Gateway. Given the options, Gateway is a specific component often missed that breaks internet access.*"
