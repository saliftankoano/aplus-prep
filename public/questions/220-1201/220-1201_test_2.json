    "question": "A customer reports their tablet was recently dropped on the ground. The tablet has a small crack in one corner of the display, and it does not charge when plugged in. Which of the following should a technician do first?",
    "options": [
      "A. Perform a hard restart.",
      "B. Replace the battery",
      "C. Inspect the USB-C port for damage",
      "D. Run diagnostics on the digitizer"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "C (Inspect the USB-C port for damage) is the correct answer. Since the device was dropped and now fails to charge, physical damage to the charging port is a likely outcome of the impact. Inspecting the port is a quick, non-intrusive first step before attempting software resets or replacing internal components like the battery."

    "question": "A customer reports that a workstation has no internet connectivity. A technician confirms the port is disabled. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the issue?",
    "options": [
      "A. Patch panel",
      "B. Physical NIC",
      "C. Managed switch",
      "D. Stand-alone firewall"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "C (Managed switch) is the correct answer. A managed switch allows administrators to configure specific ports, including enabling or disabling them. Port security features on a managed switch can also automatically disable a port if an unauthorized device connects."

    "question": "A projector has been shutting down after 30 minutes of use, and it has a strange smell The technician confirms the power source is not the cause of the issue Which of the following steps should the technician take next to resolve this issue?",
    "options": [
      "A. Replace the bulb",
      "B. Check the projector configuration.",
      "C. Clean the filter",
      "D. Adjust the gamma settings."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "C (Clean the filter) is the correct answer. Projectors generate significant heat and rely on airflow for cooling. If the dust filter is clogged, the projector will overheat and shut down (thermal protection). The \"strange smell\" is often burning dust."

      "B. OS and device version incompatibility",
      "C. Disabled settings following the upgrade",
      "D. Full storage"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "C (Disabled settings following the upgrade) is the correct answer. During an OS upgrade, privacy settings (like camera access) or radio toggles (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi) may be reset to default or disabled for security reasons. Checking these settings is the first troubleshooting step."

    "question": "A technician is troubleshooting issues occurring on a user's mobile device. Applications and the OS have slow response times, even when performing simple tasks, such as writing an email. Additionally, new applications occasionally fail to launch. Which of the following should the technician do next?",
    "options": [
      "A. Move the device to a room with a colder temperature.",
      "B. Close unnecessary programs.",
      "C. Reset to factory default settings.",
      "D. Check the battery health of the device."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "B (Close unnecessary programs.) is the correct answer. Slow performance and failure to launch apps often indicate high resource usage (RAM or CPU). Closing background apps frees up memory and processing power, restoring responsiveness."

      "B. Submit an emergency request to the local facilities manager.",
      "C. Check for foreign objects, liquid spills, and internal damage.",
      "D. Contact the vendor and submit a return request."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "A (Turn it off and disconnect all power sources.) is the correct answer. Safety is the first priority. A burning smell indicates a potential electrical short or overheating component that could lead to fire. Removing power immediately prevents further damage or injury."

      "C. Cable stripper",
      "D. Toner probe"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "D (Toner probe) is the correct answer. A toner generator places a signal on the cable, and a probe detects that signal at the other end (e.g., at the patch panel), allowing the technician to identify the specific cable in a bundle."

      "B. Rotate the image from the laptop",
      "C. Adjust the display frequency",
      "D. Flip the image vertically from the projector"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "D (Flip the image vertically from the projector) is the correct answer. Ceiling-mounted projectors are installed upside down. They have a menu setting (often called \"Ceiling Mode\" or \"Flip Vertical\") to invert the image so it appears correctly on the screen."

      "A. Flash the BIOS",
      "B. Update the drivers",
      "C. Try a different charger",
      "D. Replace the battery"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "D (Replace the battery) is the correct answer. If the laptop runs fine on AC power (docked or plugged in) but dies immediately when disconnected, the battery is unable to hold a charge and has likely reached the end of its lifespan."

    "options": ["A. RAID 0", "B. RAID 1", "C. RAID 5", "D. RAID 10"],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "A (RAID 0) is the correct answer. RAID 0 (Striping) splits data evenly across two or more disks, increasing read/write speeds significantly. It is the lowest cost performance option as it utilizes 100% of the drive capacity (unlike RAID 1/5/10 which lose capacity to redundancy). Note: It offers no fault tolerance."

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "B (Performing a physical-to-virtual conversion and hosting on IaaS) is the correct answer. P2V (Physical-to-Virtual) migration converts the existing physical server's state into a virtual machine. This VM can be hosted on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud, preserving the legacy application environment exactly as is without needing the physical hardware."

      "A. Access control list",
      "B. Audit logging",
      "C. Badging",
      "D. Print server"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "C (Badging) is the correct answer. Implementing \"Pull Printing\" or \"Follow Me Printing\" often uses ID badges (Badging) or PINs. Users print to a global queue, but the job is only released and printed when they tap their badge at a specific printer."

      "A. SMTP implementation",
      "B. Firmware update",
      "C. User authentication",
      "D. SMB configuration"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "C (User authentication) is the correct answer. Configuring user authentication on the device ensures that functions like copying or scanning are locked until a valid user logs in (via PIN, username/password, or badge), restricting access to authorized employees."

    "question": "The output from a dot matrix printer has become lighter over time. Which of the following should a technician do to fix the issue?",
    "options": [
      "A. Clean the printhead.",
      "B. Replace the ribbon.",
      "C. Install a maintenance kit.",
      "D. Calibrate the alignment."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "B (Replace the ribbon.) is the correct answer. Dot matrix printers use an ink-soaked ribbon. As the ink is used up, the print output fades. Replacing the ribbon is the standard maintenance task to restore print density."

    "options": [
      "A. Run a magnet over each drive.",
      "B. Check if one of the drives is not level",
      "C. Listen for clicking and grinding noises",
      "D. Check the OS logs"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "C (Listen for clicking and grinding noises) is the correct answer. Mechanical failure of hard drives often produces audible indicators like the \"click of death\" or grinding. If software logs are inconclusive, physical inspection (listening) can identify a failed drive in the array."

    "question": "The power supply for a user's gaming PC fails. The user installs a new power supply and connects it to the motherboard, GPU, and SSDs, but the computer will not start. What is the most likely cause?",
    "options": [
      "A. The computer requires more RAM",
      "B. The wattage is insufficient",
      "C. The user did not connect the 4-pin CPU connector",
      "D. The power supply only works in redundant configurations"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "C (The user did not connect the 4-pin CPU connector) is the correct answer. The CPU requires a dedicated power connection (4-pin or 8-pin EPS12V) separate from the main 24-pin motherboard connector. If this is forgotten, the motherboard has power but the CPU does not, preventing boot."
