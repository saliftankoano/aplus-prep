    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "B (Gateway) is the correct answer. (Note: While IP and Subnet mask are also required, the Gateway is strictly necessary to communicate *outside* the local subnet. In the context of \"connecting to the network\" broadly including internet/WAN, Gateway is critical. Often, DHCP handles all three. However, without a Gateway, you are stuck on the LAN.) *Self-correction: The question asks what to configure to connect to the network. Usually, you need IP, Subnet, and Gateway. If manually configuring, all three are needed. If the question implies what allows traffic to leave, it's Gateway. Given the options, Gateway is a specific component often missed that breaks internet access.*"

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "B (23) is the correct answer. Port 23 is used by Telnet, an unencrypted text-based protocol for remote management. Because credentials and commands are sent in cleartext, it is insecure and should be disabled in favor of SSH (Port 22)."

      "D. Swollen motherboard capacitor"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "A (Loose video cable) is the correct answer. Intermittent signal loss or flashing is most commonly caused by a loose or bad HDMI/DisplayPort cable connection. Checking physical connections is the \"Physical Layer\" troubleshooting step that should always be done first."

      "C. Fiber",
      "D. Satellite"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "C (Fiber) is the correct answer. Fiber optic internet offers the highest bandwidth available (Gigabit speeds and beyond) and typically provides symmetrical speeds (Upload speed = Download speed), unlike Cable or DSL which are usually asymmetrical."

      "A. Outdated firmware",
      "B. Incorrect driver",
      "C. Bad toner cartridge",
      "D. Corrupted document file"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "B (Incorrect driver) is the correct answer. Printing \"garbage text\" (random symbols, wingdings) usually happens when the computer is using the wrong printer driver (e.g., PCL6 driver for a PostScript printer). The printer receives commands it doesn't understand and interprets them as text."

    "question": "An end user's domain password expires while they are working from home. The end user tries to reset the password using Ctrl+Alt+Delete and then receives the following message: Configuration information could not be read from the domain controller, either because the machine is unavailable or because access is denied. Which of the following will resolve this issue?",
    "options": [
      "A. Restart the computer.",
      "B. Connect to the VPN.",
      "C. Reset the account in Active Directory.",
      "D. Join the Wi-Fi network."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "B (Connect to the VPN.) is the correct answer. To change a Domain Password, the workstation must be able to communicate with the Domain Controller (DC). From home, the PC is off-network. Connecting to the corporate VPN establishes a secure tunnel to the internal network, allowing the password reset request to reach the DC."

      "C. RAID 5",
      "D. RAID 6"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "D (RAID 6) is the correct answer. RAID 6 uses dual parity stripes across all drives. This allows it to withstand the simultaneous failure of *any two* drives in the array without losing data. (RAID 5 can only handle one drive failure)."

      "C. DSL",
      "D. Cellular"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "D (Cellular) is the correct answer. In rural or less populated areas where running cables (Fiber/Cable/DSL) is cost-prohibitive, Cellular towers (4G LTE/5G) provide wide area coverage and high speeds (especially 5G) without needing wires to every home. (Satellite has coverage but usually slower speeds/higher latency than modern cellular)."
