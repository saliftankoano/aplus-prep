Which of the following should be disabled to mitigate connection attempts?",
    "options": [
      "A. SSID",
      "B. DHCP",
      "C. Firewall",
      "D. SSD"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The SSID (Service Set Identifier) is the name of a wireless network that is broadcasted by the router or the Wi-Fi base station. The SSID helps nearby devices to identify and connect to the available networks. However, broadcasting the SSID also exposes the network to potential connection attempts from unauthorized or malicious users. Therefore, disabling the SSID can mitigate connection attempts by making the network invisible or hidden to the devices that are not already connected to it. To connect to a hidden network, the user would need to know the exact SSID and enter it manually. The other options are not related to mitigating connection attempts to the corporate Wi-Fi. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a protocol that assigns IP addresses to the devices on a network. Firewall is a software or hardware device that filters the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules. SSD (Solid State Drive) is a type of storage device that uses flash memory to store data. Disabling any of these options would not prevent connection attempts to the Wi-Fi network, and may cause other problems or issues for the network functionality and performance."
