    "options": [
      "A. Image deployment",
      "B. Recovery partition installation",
      "C. Remote network installation",
      "D. Repair installation"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Remote network installation (C) is the correct answer because it allows the engineer to install the operating system over the network without requiring physical installation media. This method uses network boot (PXE) to download the installation files from a network server. Image deployment requires pre-built images, recovery partition installation requires existing OS, and repair installation is for fixing existing installations."

      "B. Off-site backup",
      "C. Incremental backup",
      "D. Full backup"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "To accomplish this task, the technician should use a Full backup method. A full backup only requires two sets of tapes to restore because it backs up all the data from the workstation. With a differential backup, the backups need to be taken multiple times over a period of time, so more tapes would be needed to restore the data."

      "C. Reimage the workstation.",
      "D. Roll back the updates."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Repair Windows (A) is the correct answer because the BOOTMGR missing error indicates a corrupted or missing boot manager. Windows Repair can restore the boot manager without losing data. Partitioning the hard disk would destroy data, reimaging is more drastic, and rolling back updates may not fix the boot manager issue."

      "B. Disable encryption settings.",
      "C. Disable DHCP reservations.",
      "D. Disable logging."

    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Disable the SSID broadcast (A) is the correct answer because it makes the Wi-Fi network invisible to devices scanning for networks. This prevents unauthorized users from seeing and attempting to connect to the network. Disabling encryption would make the network less secure, DHCP reservations don't prevent connections, and logging doesn't block access."

      "C. To determine the affected systems",
      "D. To select a change owner"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "To evaluate the change before deployment (A) is the correct answer because sandbox testing allows organizations to test changes in an isolated environment before implementing them in production. This helps identify potential issues, conflicts, and impacts without affecting live systems. End-user acceptance, determining affected systems, and selecting change owners are other aspects of change management but not the primary purpose of sandbox testing."

    "explanation": "DNS (domain name system) is a protocol that translates domain names to IP addresses. If the computer has an incorrect DNS address assigned, it will not be able to resolve the domain names of web-based applications and access them. A firewall, a VLAN (virtual local area network) and a browser cache are not the most likely reasons for the issue, since the computer can ping known IP addresses on the internet and receive a response."

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Isolating the machine from the network is the best way to identify the source of the attack, because it prevents the malicious traffic from spreading to other devices or reaching the attacker. Isolating the machine can also help preserve the evidence of the attack, such as the malware files, the network connections, the registry entries, or the system logs.

The user must enter this code or password along with their username and password to access their account or service. A soft token can help improve security by adding an extra layer of verification and preventing unauthorized access even if the user’s credentials are compromised. A soft token can also be implemented at a minimal cost, as it does not require any additional hardware or infrastructure.
