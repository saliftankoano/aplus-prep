    "options": [
      "A. Battery backup",
      "B. Electrostatic discharge mat",
      "C. Proper ventilation",
      "D. Green disposal"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Proper ventilation (C) is the correct answer because it prevents overheating and thermal damage to device components. Proper airflow dissipates heat and maintains optimal temperature for performance. Battery backup provides power protection, ESD mats prevent static damage, and green disposal is for end-of-life management."

    "question": "A technician removed a virus from a user's device. The user returned the device a week later with the same virus on it. Which of the following should the technician do to prevent future infections?",
    "options": [
      "A. Disable System Restore.",
      "B. Educate the end user.",
      "C. Install the latest OS patches.",
      "D. Clean the environment reinstallation."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Educate the end user (B) is the correct answer because user behavior is often the primary cause of virus infections. Teaching users about safe browsing habits, avoiding suspicious links, and not downloading unknown files can prevent future infections. The other options address technical aspects but don't address the root cause of user behavior."

      "B. Shoulder surfing",
      "C. Whaling",
      "D. Tailgating"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Shoulder surfing (B) is the correct answer because privacy screens limit the viewing angle of displays, making it difficult for someone to see the screen from the side or behind. This prevents unauthorized viewing of sensitive information. Impersonation, whaling, and tailgating are social engineering attacks not related to visual privacy."

    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": ".sh (D) is the correct answer because shell scripts use the .sh extension and are natively supported by Linux systems. Shell scripts can be executed directly by the bash, sh, or other shell interpreters. .py files are for Python, .js files are for JavaScript, and .vbs files are for Visual Basic Script (Windows)."

      "C. Scope of change",
      "D. Risk analysis"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Rollback plan (B) is the correct answer because it specifically documents how to reverse or undo a change if it causes problems. This includes procedures for uninstalling patches, reverting configurations, or restoring previous states. Purpose, scope, and risk analysis are planning documents that don't include rollback procedures."

      "A. ipconfig",
      "B. arp",
      "C. nslookup",
      "D. pathping"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "pathping (D) is the correct answer because it combines the functionality of ping and tracert to provide detailed network path analysis. It shows packet loss and latency at each hop, making it ideal for troubleshooting network stability issues. ipconfig shows configuration, arp shows MAC addresses, and nslookup resolves DNS names."

      "C. Optical media",
      "D. Partition"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "USB (A) is the correct answer because it's a portable, offline method for reimaging without network access. The technician can create a bootable USB drive with the system image and imaging software. PXE requires network access, optical media is less common, and partition refers to disk structure, not imaging method."

      "C. netstat",
      "D. ping"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "ifconfig (B) is the correct answer because it displays network interface information including MAC addresses. The MAC address appears as a hexadecimal string (e.g., 00:0c:29:3f:5c:1f). net use is Windows-specific, netstat shows connections, and ping tests connectivity."

      "B. WPA2",
      "C. WPA3",
      "D. Open network"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "WPA3 (C) is the correct answer because it's the most recent and secure wireless security protocol. It provides stronger encryption, better protection against brute force attacks, and enhanced security features compared to WEP, WPA2, or open networks. WPA3 is the current industry standard for wireless security."

      "B. Restricting local administrators",
      "C. Enabling UPnP",
      "D. Turning off AutoPlay"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "AutoPlay is a feature that automatically runs programs or files when a removable media device, such as a flash drive, is plugged in. This can be exploited by malware authors who place malicious files on flash drives that execute automatically when inserted into a computer. Turning off AutoPlay can prevent this type of incident by requiring the user to manually open or run files from removable media devices. Disabling UAC (user account control), restricting local administrators and enabling UPnP (universal plug and play) are not effective ways to prevent this type of incident."
