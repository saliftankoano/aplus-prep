    "question": "Which of the following components is most likely to fail if a laptop is dropped and the screen becomes unresponsive to touch?",
    "options": [
      "A. CPU",
      "B. Hard drive",
      "C. RAM",
      "D. Touch screen"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Touch screen (D) is the correct answer because physical damage from dropping a laptop can break the touch screen digitizer or damage the touch-sensitive layer. The touch screen is the most vulnerable component to physical impact damage. CPU, hard drive, and RAM are internal components that are better protected by the laptop's chassis."

    "question": "Which of the following Windows tools would a technician use to configure system policies and restrictions?",
    "options": [
      "A. Disk Cleanup",
      "B. Group Policy Editor",
      "C. Disk Management",
      "D. Resource Monitor"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Group Policy Editor (B) is the correct answer because it allows technicians to configure system policies, security settings, and user restrictions. Group Policy Editor is the primary tool for managing Windows system configurations in domain environments. Disk Cleanup removes temporary files, Disk Management handles partitions, and Resource Monitor shows system performance."

    "question": "Which of the following backup types only backs up files that have changed since the last backup?",
    "options": [
      "A. Full",
      "B. Mirror",
      "C. Incremental",
      "D. Differential"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Differential (D) is the correct answer because it backs up all files that have changed since the last full backup. Differential backups are faster than full backups but slower than incremental backups. Full backups copy all data, Mirror creates exact copies, and Incremental only backs up changes since the last backup (full or incremental)."

    "question": "Which of the following operating systems is designed primarily for web-based applications and cloud services?",
    "options": [
      "A. Linux",
      "B. Microsoft Windows",
      "C. iOS",
      "D. Chromium"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Chromium (D) is the correct answer because it's designed as a web-focused operating system that runs primarily through a web browser interface. Chromium OS is the foundation for Chrome OS and is optimized for cloud-based applications and services. Linux, Windows, and iOS are full-featured operating systems with broader application support."

    "question": "Which of the following security measures should be implemented when a corporate device is lost or stolen?",
    "options": [
      "A. Changing the office's Wi-Fi SSID and password",
      "B. Performing a remote wipe on the device",
      "C. Changing the user's password",
      "D. Enabling remote drive encryption"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Performing a remote wipe on the device (B) is the correct answer because it immediately removes all corporate data from the lost device, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information. Remote wipe is the most effective security measure for lost corporate devices. The other options are preventive measures but don't address the immediate security risk."

    "id": 396,
    "question": "Which of the following is the first step in the change management process?",
    "options": [
      "A. Document the date and time of the change.",
      "B. Submit a change request form",
      "C. Determine the risk level of this change",
      "D. Request an unused IP address."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Submit a change request form (B) is the correct answer because it's the first step in formal change management. The change request form documents what needs to be changed, why it's needed, and who will be affected. This initiates the formal change management process. The other options are steps that come later in the process."

  {
    "id": 397,
    "question": "Which of the following is the final step in the change management process?",
    "options": [
      "A. Risk analysis",
      "B. Sandbox testing",
      "C. End user acceptance",
      "D. Lessons learned"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Lessons learned (D) is the correct answer because it's the final step in the change management process where the team reviews what went well and what could be improved for future changes. This step helps improve the change management process for future implementations. Risk analysis and sandbox testing are earlier steps, and end user acceptance comes before lessons learned."

    "id": 398,
    "question": "Which of the following backup types backs up only files that have changed since the last backup (full or incremental)?",
    "options": [
      "A. Differential backup",
      "B. Off-site backup",
      "C. Incremental backup",
      "D. Full backup"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Incremental backup (C) is the correct answer because it only backs up files that have changed since the last backup (whether that was a full backup or another incremental backup). This makes incremental backups the fastest and most space-efficient backup type. Differential backs up all changes since the last full backup, and full backup copies everything."

    "question": "Which of the following Windows tools would a technician use to manage hardware devices and drivers?",
    "options": [
      "A. Device Manager",
      "B. Indexing Options",
      "C. File Explorer",
      "D. Administrative Tools"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Device Manager (A) is the correct answer because it's the primary Windows tool for managing hardware devices and their drivers. Device Manager allows technicians to view, update, rollback, and troubleshoot device drivers. Indexing Options manages file indexing, File Explorer is for file management, and Administrative Tools is a collection of system utilities."

    "question": "Which of the following filesystems is the default for modern Windows operating systems?",
    "options": [
      "A. NTFS",
      "B. FAT32",
      "C. exFAT",
      "D. ext4"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "NTFS (A) is the correct answer because it's the default filesystem for modern Windows operating systems. NTFS provides better security, reliability, and performance compared to FAT32. NTFS supports file permissions, encryption, compression, and journaling. FAT32 is older and has limitations, exFAT is for removable drives, and ext4 is for Linux systems."
