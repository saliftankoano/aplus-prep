    "question": "A company is recycling old hard drives and wants to quickly reprovision the drives for reuse. Which of the following data destruction methods should the company use?",
    "options": [
      "A. Degaussing",
      "B. Standard formatting",
      "C. Low-level wiping",
      "D. Deleting"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Low-level wiping (C) is the correct answer because it overwrites every bit of data on the hard drive with zeros or random patterns, making data recovery impossible. This method also restores the drive to factory state. Degaussing destroys the drive, standard formatting leaves data recoverable, and deleting only marks space as free."

      "B. Thermal paste",
      "C. ESD strap",
      "D. Consistent power"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "ESD strap (C) is the correct answer because it prevents electrostatic discharge that can damage sensitive electronic components like RAM. An ESD strap connects the technician to a grounded surface, equalizing electrical potential. Battery backup, thermal paste, and consistent power are not related to ESD protection."

      "C. Antivirus",
      "D. Firewall"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Firewall (D) is the correct answer because it monitors and controls network traffic, allowing users to block unauthorized connections and receive alerts when applications try to access the internet. OS updates, remote wipe, and antivirus don't specifically address network traffic monitoring."

      "D. WPA2/AES"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,

      "D. Replace the screen."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "APFS (D) is the correct answer because it's the default filesystem for macOS since High Sierra (10.13). APFS is optimized for flash storage and supports encryption, snapshots, and cloning. ext4 is for Linux, exFAT is for removable drives, and NTFS is for Windows."

      "C. Antivirus application",
      "D. Anti-malware scans"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,

      "C. rmdir",
      "D. md"

Upon reboot, the technician notices an alert stating the workstation has malware in the root OS folder. The technician promptly performs a System Restore and reboots the workstation, but the malware is still detected. Which of the following BEST describes why the system still has malware?",
    "options": [
      "A. A system patch disabled the antivirus protection and host firewall.",
      "B. The system updates did not include the latest anti-malware definitions.",
      "C. The system restore process was compromised by the malware.",
      "D. The malware was installed before the system restore point was created."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The malware was installed before the system restore point was created (D) is the correct answer because System Restore only reverts to a previous point in time. If malware was present when the restore point was created, it will still be there after restoration. The other options don't explain why malware persists after System Restore."

      "C. DRM",
      "D. Open-source agreement"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "EULA (A) is the correct answer because End User License Agreements typically prohibit installing home edition software on multiple computers in a business environment. Home editions are usually licensed for personal use only. PII refers to personal information, DRM is digital rights management, and open-source agreements are different."

      "C. Screen Sharing",
      "D. VNC"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Screen Sharing (C) is the correct answer because it's a built-in macOS tool that allows technicians to view and control a user's screen remotely. Remote Assistance is Windows-specific, RDP is Microsoft's protocol, and VNC is a third-party solution."

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The user is not connected to the VPN (A) is the correct answer because a VPN establishes a secure tunnel between the user's device and the corporate network. If the user is not connected to the VPN, they cannot access network drives. The file server being offline (B) and a low battery (C) are not related to network drive connectivity. The log-in script failed (D) is a different issue."

A technician should instruct the user to: - A. clear the browser cache and contact the bank. - B. close out of the site and contact the bank.C. continue to the site and contact the bank. D. update the browser and contact the bank.Explanation: The technician should instruct the user to clear the browser cache and contact the bank (option A). This error indicates that the website the user is visiting is not the correct website and is likely due to a cached version of the website being stored in the user's browser. Clearing the browser cache should remove any stored versions of the website and allow the user to access the correct website. The user should also contact the bank to confirm that they are visiting the correct website and to report the error. 117.

    "explanation": "The most likely agreement in use here is a EULA (End User License Agreement). This is a legally binding agreement between the user and the software developer, outlining the terms and conditions that the user must agree to in order to use the software. It is important that the user understands and agrees to the EULA before they can proceed with downloading and installing the software.

      "C. Check that the accessory is ready to pair.",
      "D. Clear all devices from the phone's Bluetooth settings."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Check that the accessory is ready to pair (C) is the correct answer because it's a common troubleshooting step for Bluetooth connectivity issues. If the accessory is not ready to pair, it means the Bluetooth is turned on but not in a state where it can establish a connection. Restarting the device (A) and turning on airplane mode (B) are not directly related to the Bluetooth accessory's readiness. Clearing all devices (D) is a more drastic step and might be needed if the issue persists."

An ODDS attack is a distributed denial-of-service attack, where multiple compromised workstations send traffic to a target, overwhelming it. The workstations themselves are not malicious, but they are part of the attack vector. Keyloggers (B), Adware (C), and Botnets (D) are types of malware, not attacks."

It can help troubleshoot and diagnose problems, such as unexpected shutdowns, by showing the details of what happened before, during, and after the incident. It can also show the source of the event, such as an application, a service, a driver, or a hardware device. By using Event Viewer, a technician can identify the root cause of the unexpected shutdown, such as a power failure, a thermal event, a driver conflict, or a malware infection."
