    "question": "Remote network installation is the best option for configuring a new server that requires a bare-metal installation without installation media on site. A remote network installation is a method of installing an operating system or an application over a network connection, such as LAN, WAN, or Internet. A remote network installation can use various protocols, such as PXE, HTTP, FTP, or SMB, to access the installation files from a server or a cloud service. A remote network installation can also use various tools, such as Windows Deployment Services, Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, or Red Hat Kickstart, to automate and customize the installation process. A remote network installation can save time and resources by eliminating the need for physical media and allowing centralized management of multiple installations. Image deployment, recovery partition installation, and repair installation are not correct answers for this question. Image deployment is a method of installing an operating system or an application by copying a preconfigured image file to a target device. Image deployment requires an existing image file and a compatible device. Recovery partition installation is a method of restoring an operating system or an application from a hidden partition on the hard disk that contains the original factory settings. Recovery partition installation requires an existing recovery partition and a functional hard disk. Repair installation is a method of fixing an operating system or an application that is corrupted or damaged by replacing or repairing the system files without affecting the user data or settings. Repair installation requires an existing operating system or application and a working device.",

However, a System Restore does not affect personal files or folders, and it may not remove malware that was already present on the system before the restore point was created. A system patch disabling the antivirus protection and host firewall may increase the risk of malware infection, but it does not explain why the malware persists after a System Restore. The system updates not including the latest anti-malware definitions may reduce the effectiveness of malware detection and removal, but it does not explain why the malware persists after a System Restore.

    "question": "The technician should adjust the firewall settings to resolve the issue of not being able to access an internal site at https://companyintranet.com:8888. The firewall settings control how the firewall filters and allows network traffic based on rules and policies. The firewall settings may be blocking or preventing the access to the internal site by mistake or by default, especially if the site uses a non-standard port number such as 8888. The technician should check and modify the firewall settings to allow the access to the internal site or its port number. Default gateway settings determine how a computer connects to other networks or the internet. Default gateway settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access the public internet. DHCP settings determine how a computer obtains its IP address and other network configuration parameters automatically from a DHCP server. DHCP settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access other network resources. IP address settings determine how a computer identifies itself and communicates with other devices on a network. IP address settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access other network resources. Antivirus settings control how the antivirus software scans and protects the computer from malware and threats. Antivirus settings are less likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site than firewall settings, unless the antivirus software has its own firewall feature that may interfere with the network traffic.
