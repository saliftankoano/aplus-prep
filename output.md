## Question 9

A network technician is deploying a new machine in a small branch office that does not have a DHCP server. The new machine automatically receives the IP address of 169.254.0.2 and is unable to communicate with the rest of the network. Which of the following would restore communication?

**A.** Static entry

**B.** ARP table

**C.** APIPA address

**D.** NTP specification

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

The new machine automatically receives the IP address of 169.254.0.2 because it uses APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing), which is a feature that enables computers to self-assign an IP address when a DHCP server is not available. However, APIPA only works for local communication within the same subnet, and does not provide a default gateway or a DNS server. Therefore, the new machine is unable to communicate with the rest of the network, which may be on a different subnet or require a gateway or a DNS server to access. The other options are not related to restoring communication for the new machine. ARP table is a cache that stores the mapping between IP addresses and MAC addresses for the devices on the network. NTP specification is a protocol that synchronizes the clocks of the devices on the network.

## Question 18

[What is RDP and How Does It Work? - CompTIA] based on their source, destination, protocol, port, or content. A software firewall can also block or allow specific applications or services from communicating with the network, and alert the administrator of any suspicious or malicious activity12. A software firewall is a better option than the other choices because: - Password complexity (B) is a good practice to protect the file server from unauthorized access, but it is not sufficient by itself. Password complexity refers to the use of strong passwords that are hard to guess or crack by attackers, and that are changed frequently and securely. Password complexity can prevent brute force attacks or credential theft, but it cannot stop network attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the file server software or hardware, or that bypass the authentication process34. - Antivirus application (C) and anti-malware scans (D) are important tools to protect the file server from viruses and malware that can infect, damage, or encrypt the stored files. However, they are not effective in preventing unauthorized LAN devices from accessing the files in the first place. Antivirus and anti-malware tools can only detect and remove known threats, and they may not be able to stop zero-day attacks or advanced persistent threats that can evade or disable them. Moreover, antivirus and anti-malware tools cannot control the network traffic or the file server permissions, and they may not be compatible with all file server platforms or configurations56.

**A.** Chrome OS

**B.** macOS

**C.** Windows

**D.** Linux

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

A technician is unable to access the internet or named network resources. The technician receives a valid IP address from the DHCP server and can ping the default gateway. Which of the following should the technician check next to resolve the issue? - A. Verify the DNS server settings. - B. Turn off the Windows firewall. - C. Confirm the subnet mask is correct. - D. Configure a static IP address. Answer: A The correct answer is A. Verify the DNS server settings. This is because the DNS server is responsible for resolving domain names to IP addresses, which is necessary for accessing the internet or named network resources. If the DNS server settings are incorrect or the DNS server is down, the technician will not be able to access these resources even if they have a valid IP address and can ping the default gateway1. 1: CompTIA A+ Certification Exam: Core 2 Objectives, page 16, section 1.10. A technician is creating a location on a Windows workstation for a customer to store meeting minutes. Which of the following commands should the technician use? - A. c: \minutes - B. dir - C. rmdir - D. md Answer: D A customer recently experienced a power outage at a SOHO. The customer does not think the components are connected properly. A print job continued running for several minutes after the power failed, but the customer was not able to interact with the computer. Once the UPS stopped beeping, all functioning devices also turned off. In case of a future power failure, the customer wants to have the most time available to save cloud documents and shut down the computer without losing any data. Answer: 60 UPS > Surge protector = Computer, wifi router, cable modem Surge protector = wallOutlet, printer and scanner A Windows workstation that was recently updated with approved system patches shut down instead of restarting. Upon reboot, the technician notices an alert stating the workstation has malware in the root OS folder. The technician promptly performs a System Restore and reboots the workstation, but the malware is still detected. Which of the following BEST describes why the system still has malware? - A. A system patch disabled the antivirus protection and host firewall. - B. The system updates did not include the latest anti-malware definitions. - C. The system restore process was compromised by the malware. - D. The malware was installed before the system restore point was created. Answer: D The best explanation for why the system still has malware after performing a System Restore is that the malware was installed before the system restore point was created. A system restore point is a snapshot of the system settings and configuration at a certain point in time. A System Restore is a feature that allows users to restore their system to a previous state in case of problems or errors. However, a System Restore does not affect personal files or folders, and it may not remove malware that was already present on the system before the restore point was created. A system patch disabling the antivirus protection and host firewall may increase the risk of malware infection, but it does not explain why the malware persists after a System Restore. The system updates not including the latest anti-malware definitions may reduce the effectiveness of malware detection and removal, but it does not explain why the malware persists after a System Restore. The system restore process being compromised by the malware may prevent a successful System Restore, but it does not explain why the malware persists after a System Restore.

## Question 33

A Chief Executive Officer has learned that an exploit has been identified on the web server software, and a patch is not available yet. Which of the following attacks MOST likely occurred?

**A.** Brute force

**B.** Zero day

**C.** Denial of service

**D.** On-path

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

Answer: A Logging into a user's account without their explicit permission is a violation of the acceptable use policy, which outlines the rules and regulations by which a user must abide while using a computer system. By logging into the user's account without their permission, the technician would be violating this policy. Additionally, this action could be seen as a breach of confidentiality, as the technician would have access to information that should remain confidential. A user is unable to access a website, which is widely used across the organization, and receives the following error message: The security certificate presented by this website has expired or is not yet valid.

Which of the following should the technician perform NEXT to troubleshoot the issue? - A. Reboot the computer. - B. Reinstall the OS. - C. Configure a static 12 - D. Check the computer's date and time. Answer: D The error message indicates that the security certificate presented by the website has either expired or is not yet valid. This can happen if the computer's clock has the wrong date or time, as SSL/TLS certificates have a specific validity period. If the clock is off by too much, it may cause the certificate to fail to validate. Therefore, the technician should check the computer's date and time and ensure that they are correct. A technician receives a ticket indicating the user cannot resolve external web pages. However, specific IP addresses are working. Which of the following does the technician MOST likely need to change on the workstation to resolve the issue? - A. Default gateway - B. Host address C. Name server D. Subnet mask Answer: A A. Full B. Incremental C. Differential D. Synthetic Answer: A Full backup is the best option to ensure that the restore process is as simple as possible. A full backup is a backup type that copies all the data from the source to the destination, regardless of whether the data has changed or not. A full backup provides the most complete and consistent backup of the data, and it allows the user to restore the data from a single backup set without relying on any previous or subsequent backups. Incremental, differential, and synthetic backups are not as simple as full backups for restoring data. An incremental backup is a backup type that copies only the data that has changed since the last backup, whether it was full or incremental. An incremental backup requires less time and space than a full backup, but it also requires multiple backup sets to restore the data completely. A differential backup is a backup type that copies only the data that has changed since the last full backup. A differential backup requires more time and space than an incremental backup, but it also requires fewer backup sets to restore the data than an incremental backup. A synthetic backup is a backup type that combines a full backup with one or more incremental or differential backups to create a consolidated backup set. A synthetic backup requires less time and bandwidth than a full backup, but it also requires more processing power and storage space than an incremental or differential backup.

The end users report that traffic to certain internal environments is not stable and often drops. Which of the following command-line tools can provide the most detailed information for investigating the issue further? - A. ipconfig - B. arp - C. nslookup - D. pathping Answer: D Pathping is the best command-line tool to provide the most detailed information for investigating the network performance issues. Pathping is a utility that combines the functions of ping and tracert, which are two other command-line tools that test network connectivity and latency. Pathping sends packets to each router on the path to a destination and then computes results based on the packets returned from each hop. Pathping can show the route taken by the packets, the number of hops, the latency of each hop, and the packet loss percentage. This information can help the systems administrator identify where the network problem occurs and how severe it is. Ipconfig, arp, and nslookup are not as useful as pathping for this task. Ipconfig shows the configuration of the network interface card, such as IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. Arp shows the mapping of IP addresses to MAC addresses in the local network. Nslookup queries DNS servers for domain name resolution. - Official CompTIA learning resources CompTIA A+ Core 1 and Core 2, page 21 - CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1101) and Core 2 (220-1102) Cert Guide, page 457 A.

A user's Windows computer seems to work well at the beginning of the day. However, its performance degrades throughout the day, and the system freezes when several applications are open. Which of the following should a technician do to resolve the issue? (Select two). - A. Install the latest GPU drivers. - B. Reinstall the OS. - C. Increase the RAM. - D. Increase the hard drive space. - E. Uninstall unnecessary software. - F. Disable scheduled tasks. Answer: C, E The most likely causes of the user’s Windows computer performance degradation and freezing are insufficient RAM and excessive software running in the background. Therefore, the technician should do the following to resolve the issue: - Increase the RAM. RAM is the memory that the computer uses to store and run applications and processes. If the RAM is not enough to handle the workload, the computer will use the hard drive as a virtual memory, which is much slower and can cause performance issues. Increasing the RAM will allow the computer to run more applications and processes smoothly and avoid freezing. The technician should check the system requirements of the applications that the user needs to run, and install additional RAM modules that are compatible with the motherboard and the existing RAM. The technician should also make sure that the system is managing the page file size automatically, or adjust it manually to optimize the virtual memory usage. - Uninstall unnecessary software. Software that the user does not need or use can take up valuable disk space and system resources, and can interfere with the performance of other applications. Some software may also run in the background or start automatically when the computer boots up, which can slow down the system and cause freezing. The technician should help the user to identify and uninstall unnecessary software from the control panel or the settings app, and disable unnecessary startup programs from the task manager or the system configuration tool. The technician should also check for and remove viruses. and malware that may affect the system performance134.

## Question 67

A developer reports that a workstation's database file extensions have been changed from .db to .enc. The developer is also unable to open the database files manually. Which of the following is the best option for recovering the data?

**A.** Accessing a restore point

**B.** Rebooting into safe mode

**C.** Utilizing the backups

**D.** Using an AV to scan the affected files

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

The best option for recovering the data is to utilize the backups, assuming that the backups are recent, valid, and not affected by the ransomware. Backups are copies of the data that are stored in a separate location or device, and can be used to restore the data in case of a disaster, such as a ransomware attack. By restoring the data from the backups, the developer can avoid paying the ransom and losing the data permanently. Accessing a restore point is not a good option, because restore points are snapshots of the system settings and configuration, not the data files. Restore points can help to undo some system changes, such as installing a faulty driver or software, but they cannot recover the encrypted data files. Rebooting into safe mode is also not a good option, because safe mode is a diagnostic mode that allows the system to run with minimal drivers and services, but it does not affect the data files. Safe mode can help to troubleshoot some system issues, such as malware infections, but it cannot decrypt the data files. Using an AV to scan the affected files is also not a good option, because an AV is a software that can detect and remove some malware, but it cannot decrypt the data files. An AV can help to prevent or remove some ransomware infections, but it cannot recover the encrypted data files.

The five primary partitions should contain 4TB of free space. Which of the following partition styles should the technician use to partition the device? A. EFS A. GPT B. MBR C. FAT32 Answer: B GPT is the correct answer for this question. GPT stands for GUID Partition Table, and it is a partition style that supports up to 128 primary partitions and up to 18 exabytes of disk size per partition. GPT also uses a unique identifier for each partition and provides better data protection and recovery. GPT is suitable for partitioning a hard disk that has five primary partitions with 4TB of free space each. EFS, MBR, and FAT32 are not correct answers for this question. EFS stands for Encrypting File System, and it is a feature that allows encrypting files and folders on NTFS volumes. EFS is not a partition style, but rather a file system attribute. MBR stands for Master Boot Record, and it is an older partition style that supports up to four primary partitions and up to 2TB of disk size per partition. MBR cannot handle five primary partitions with 4TB of free space each. FAT32 stands for File Allocation Table 32, and it is a file system that supports up to 32GB of disk size per partition and up to 4GB of file size. FAT32 is not a partition style, but rather a file system type. - Official CompTIA learning resources CompTIA A+ Core 1 and Core 2, page 14 - CompTIA A+ Complete Study Guide: Core 1 Exam 220-1101 and Core 2 Exam …, page 105

## Question 72

An implementation specialist is replacing a legacy system at a vendor site that has only one wireless When the specialist connects to Wi-Fi, the specialist realizes the insecure network has open authentication. The technician needs to secure the vendor's sensitive data. Which of the following should the specialist do FIRST to protect the company's data?

**A.** Manually configure an IP address, a subnet mask, and a default gateway.

**B.** Connect to the vendor's network using a VPN.

**C.** Change the network location to private.

**D.** Configure MFA on the network.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

The first thing that the specialist should do to protect the company’s data on an insecure network with open authentication is to connect to the vendor’s network using a VPN. A VPN stands for Virtual Private Network and is a technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection over a public or untrusted network. A VPN can protect the company’s data by preventing eavesdropping, interception or modification of the network traffic by unauthorized parties. A VPN can also provide access to the company’s internal network and resources remotely. Manually configuring an IP address, a subnet mask and a default gateway may not be necessary or possible if the vendor’s network uses DHCP to assign network configuration parameters automatically. Manually configuring an IP address, a subnet mask and a default gateway does not protect the company’s data from network attacks or threats. Changing the network location to private may not be advisable or effective if the vendor’s network is a public or untrusted network. Changing the network location to private does not protect the company’s data from network attacks or threats. Configuring MFA on the network may not be feasible or sufficient if the vendor’s network has open authentication and does not support or require MFA. Configuring MFA on the network does not protect the company’s data from network attacks or threats.

## Question 75

A field technician applied a Group Policy setting to all the workstations in the network. This setting forced the workstations to use a specific SNTP server. Users are unable to log in now. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause of this issue?

**A.** The SNTP server is offline.

**B.** A user changed the time zone on a local machine.

**C.** The Group Policy setting has disrupted domain authentication on the system.

**D.** The workstations and the authentication server have a system clock difference.

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

The workstations and the authentication server have a system clock difference. If a Group Policy setting is applied that forces the workstations to use a specific SNTP server, but the system clock on the workstations and the authentication server are out of sync, then this can cause authentication issues and users will be unable to log in. In this case, the most likely cause of the issue is a difference in system clocks and the technician should ensure that the clocks on the workstations and the authentication server are in sync.

A EULA specifies in detail the rights and restrictions which apply to the use of the software. Some of the main terms included in an EULA are the terms and scope of the license, any licensing fees, warranties and disclaimers, limitation of liability, revocation or termination of the license, and intellectual property information and restrictions on using the license (e.g. modification and copying). https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/eula-vs-terms-conditions/ malware. Which of the following will MOST likely help to permanently remove the malware? - A. Enabling System Restore - B. Educating the user - C. Booting into safe mode - D. Scheduling a scan Answer: B Although updating the anti-malware software and running scans are important steps in removing malware, they may not be sufficient to permanently remove the malware if the user keeps engaging in behaviors that leave the system vulnerable, such as downloading unknown files or visiting malicious websites. Therefore, educating the user on safe computing practices is the best way to prevent future infections and permanently remove the malware. Enabling System Restore, Booting into safe mode, and scheduling a scan are not the most efficient ways to permanently remove the malware. Enabling System Restore and Booting into safe mode may help in some cases, but they may not be sufficient to permanently remove the malware. Scheduling a scan is also important for detecting and removing malware, but it may not be sufficient to prevent future infections. https://partners.comptia.org/docs/default-source/resources/comptia-a-220-1102-exam-objectives-(3-0)

## Question 78

A company recently outsourced its night-shift cleaning service. A technician is concerned about having unsupervised contractors in the building. Which of the following security measures can be used to prevent the computers from being accessed? (Select two).

**A.** Implementing data-at-rest encryption

**B.** Disabling AutoRun

**C.** Restricting user permissions

**D.** Restricting log-in times

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

One of the common reasons for a slow smartphone performance is having too many apps installed and running in the background. These apps consume the device’s memory (RAM) and CPU resources, which can affect the speed and responsiveness of the phone. Rebooting the phone can temporarily clear the RAM and stop some background processes, but they may resume after a while. Connecting to a different network does not affect the performance of the phone, unless the network is congested or has a poor signal. The user can improve the phone’s performance by uninstalling unused apps, clearing app caches, and restricting background activities12. Malware can also slow down a phone, but it is not the most likely cause in this scenario, as the user does not report any other symptoms of infection, such as pop-ups, battery drain, or data usage spikes3. Jailbreaking a phone can also affect its performance, but it is not a cause, rather a consequence, of the user’s actions. Jailbreaking is the process of removing the manufacturer’s restrictions on a phone, which allows the user to install unauthorized apps, customize the system, and access root privileges4. However, jailbreaking also exposes the phone to security risks, voids the warranty, and may cause instability or compatibility issues5. References1: Speed up a slow Android device - Android Help - Google Help2: Why your phone slows down over time and what you can do to stop it | TechRadar3: How to tell if your phone has a virus | Norton4: What is Jailbreaking? - Definition from Techopedia5: What is Jailbreaking an iPhone? - Lifewire - A. Corporate - B. Perpetual - C. Open-source - D. Personal Answer: A A corporate EULA is a type of end-user license agreement that is designed for a large organization that needs to use proprietary software with vendor support for a multiuser environment. A corporate EULA typically grants the organization a volume license that allows it to install and use the software on multiple devices or servers, and to distribute the software to its employees or affiliates. A corporate EULA also usually provides the organization with technical support, maintenance, updates, and warranty from the software vendor, as well as some customization options and discounts. A corporate EULA may also include terms and conditions that specify the rights and obligations of both parties, such as confidentiality, liability, indemnification, termination, and dispute resolution12. A corporate EULA is a better option than the other choices because: - An open-source EULA is a type of end-user license agreement that grants the user a license to use, modify, and redistribute the software, which is publicly available and free of charge. However, an open-source EULA does not provide any vendor support, maintenance, updates, or warranty, and it may impose some restrictions or obligations on the user, such as disclosing the source code, attributing the original author, or using a compatible license for derivative works. An open-source EULA may not be suitable for a large organization that needs proprietary software with vendor support for a multiuser environment. A personal EULA is a type of end-user license agreement that grants the user a license to use the software for personal, non-commercial purposes only. A personal EULA may limit the number of devices or servers that the user can install the software on, and prohibit the user from distributing, copying, or reselling the software to other users. A personal EULA may also provide limited or no vendor support, maintenance, updates, or warranty, and it may have a fixed or renewable term. A personal EULA may not meet the needs of a large organization that needs proprietary software with vendor support for a multiuser environment.
