## Question 1

An engineer is configuring a new server that requires a bare-metal installation. Which of the following installation methods should the engineer use if installation media is not available on site?

**A.** Image deployment

**B.** Recovery partition installation

**C.** Remote network installation

**D.** Repair installation

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

Remote network installation is the best option for configuring a new server that requires a bare-metal installation without installation media on site. A remote network installation is a method of installing an operating system or an application over a network connection, such as LAN, WAN, or Internet. A remote network installation can use various protocols, such as PXE, HTTP, FTP, or SMB, to access the installation files from a server or a cloud service. A remote network installation can also use various tools, such as Windows Deployment Services, Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, or Red Hat Kickstart, to automate and customize the installation process. A remote network installation can save time and resources by eliminating the need for physical media and allowing centralized management of multiple installations. Image deployment, recovery partition installation, and repair installation are not correct answers for this question. Image deployment is a method of installing an operating system or an application by copying a preconfigured image file to a target device. Image deployment requires an existing image file and a compatible device. Recovery partition installation is a method of restoring an operating system or an application from a hidden partition on the hard disk that contains the original factory settings. Recovery partition installation requires an existing recovery partition and a functional hard disk. Repair installation is a method of fixing an operating system or an application that is corrupted or damaged by replacing or repairing the system files without affecting the user data or settings. Repair installation requires an existing operating system or application and a working device. - ✑ Official CompTIA learning resources CompTIA A+ Core 1 and Core 2, page 16 - ✑ CompTIA A+ Complete Study Guide: Core 1 Exam 220-1101 and Core 2 Exam …, page 106

## Question 68

A customer recently experienced a power outage at a SOHO. The customer does not think the components are connected properly. A print job continued running for several minutes after the power failed, but the customer was not able to interact with the computer. Once the UPS stopped beeping, all functioning devices also turned off. In case of a future power failure, the customer wants to have the most time available to save cloud documents and shut down the computer without losing any data. Answer: 60 UPS > Surge protector = Computer, wifi router, cable modem Surge protector = wallOutlet, printer and scanner A Windows workstation that was recently updated with approved system patches shut down instead of restarting. Upon reboot, the technician notices an alert stating the workstation has malware in the root OS folder. The technician promptly performs a System Restore and reboots the workstation, but the malware is still detected. Which of the following BEST describes why the system still has malware?

**A.** A system patch disabled the antivirus protection and host firewall.

**B.** The system updates did not include the latest anti-malware definitions.

**C.** The system restore process was compromised by the malware.

**D.** The malware was installed before the system restore point was created.

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

The best explanation for why the system still has malware after performing a System Restore is that the malware was installed before the system restore point was created. A system restore point is a snapshot of the system settings and configuration at a certain point in time. A System Restore is a feature that allows users to restore their system to a previous state in case of problems or errors. However, a System Restore does not affect personal files or folders, and it may not remove malware that was already present on the system before the restore point was created. A system patch disabling the antivirus protection and host firewall may increase the risk of malware infection, but it does not explain why the malware persists after a System Restore. The system updates not including the latest anti-malware definitions may reduce the effectiveness of malware detection and removal, but it does not explain why the malware persists after a System Restore. The system restore process being compromised by the malware may prevent a successful System Restore, but it does not explain why the malware persists after a System Restore. A technician is unable to completely start up a system. The OS freezes when the desktop background appears, and the issue persists when the system is restarted.

Open-ended questions are questions that require more than a yes or no answer and encourage the customer to provide more details and information. Using open-ended questions can help the support technician to understand the problem better, identify the root cause, and find a suitable solution. Some examples of open-ended questions are: - What exactly is not working on your machine? - When did you notice the problem? - How often does the problem occur? - What were you doing when the problem happened? - What have you tried to fix the problem? Offering to wipe and reset the device for the customer is not a good option, as it may result in data loss and inconvenience for the customer. It should be used as a last resort only if other troubleshooting steps fail. Advising that the help desk will investigate and follow up at a later date is not a good option, as it may leave the customer unsatisfied and frustrated. It should be used only if the problem requires further research or escalation and cannot be resolved on the first call. Putting the customer on hold and escalating the call to a manager is not a good option, as it may waste time and resources. It should be used only if the problem is beyond the support technician’s scope or authority and requires managerial intervention.

This ensures that the file system can be restored to a consistent state in case of a power failure or system crash. - The possibility of file corruption is reduced. The journaling feature of ext3 also... reduces the possibility of file corruption, as it avoids the need for a full file system check after an unclean shutdown. The file system can be quickly replayed from the journal and any inconsistencies can be fixed12. ✑ Data recovery is easy. The ext3 file system supports undeletion of files using tools such as ext3grep or extundelete, which can scan the file system for deleted inodes and attempt to recover the data blocks associated with them34. 1: Introduction to Linux File System [Structure and Types] - MiniTool1

**C.** IP address settings

**D.** Firewall settings

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

The technician should adjust the firewall settings to resolve the issue of not being able to access an internal site at https://companyintranet.com:8888. The firewall settings control how the firewall filters and allows network traffic based on rules and policies. The firewall settings may be blocking or preventing the access to the internal site by mistake or by default, especially if the site uses a non-standard port number such as 8888. The technician should check and modify the firewall settings to allow the access to the internal site or its port number. Default gateway settings determine how a computer connects to other networks or the internet. Default gateway settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access the public internet. DHCP settings determine how a computer obtains its IP address and other network configuration parameters automatically from a DHCP server. DHCP settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access other network resources. IP address settings determine how a computer identifies itself and communicates with other devices on a network. IP address settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access other network resources. Antivirus settings control how the antivirus software scans and protects the computer from malware and threats. Antivirus settings are less likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site than firewall settings, unless the antivirus software has its own firewall feature that may interfere with the network traffic.

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

The protocol that most likely allowed the data theft to occur is SMB over TCP port 445. SMB is a network file sharing protocol that enables access to files, printers, and other resources on a network. Port 445 is used by SMB to communicate directly over TCP without the need for NetBIOS, which is an older and less secure protocol. The security log shows that the source IP address 192.168.1.1 sent a file named secrets.zip using SMB protocol to the destination IP address 192.168.1.50, which captured the file. The Windows firewall information shows that port 445 is enabled for inbound and outbound traffic, which means that it is not blocked by the firewall.

## Question 148

According to CompTIA A+ Core 2 documents, "When connecting multiple displays to a system, the cables used to connect the displays must be swapped between the displays. For example, if a monitor is connected to a system using a VGA cable, the VGA cable must be moved to the next display to allow the mouse to move between the two displays." A technician is familiar with most personnel at a customer's location and has clearance to work unsupervised. Which of the following describes how the technician should handle personal communication while on site?

**A.** Respond to calls and text messages while on site but not when working directly with personnel.

**B.** Respond to calls and text messages only from family.

**C.** Respond to calls and text messages only when an emergency situation requires a response.

**D.** Respond to calls and text messages discreetly while on site.

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

A technician should handle personal communication while on site in a professional and respectful manner. According to the CompTIA A+ Core 2 (220-1102) exam objectives, one of the best practices for communication skills is to “avoid distractions and interruptions” when working with customers1. This means that the technician should not respond to calls and text messages that are not related to the work or the customer, unless there is an emergency situation that requires a response. Responding to personal communication while on site can be seen as rude, unprofessional, and disrespectful to the customer and their time. It can also affect the quality and efficiency of the technician’s work and cause errors or delays. Therefore, the technician should only respond to calls and text messages when an emergency situation requires a response, and inform the customer about the situation and apologize for the interruption. The other options are not appropriate for handling personal communication while on site. Responding to calls and text messages while on site but not when working directly with personnel (A) is still distracting and unprofessional, as it can interfere with the technician’s focus and productivity. Responding to calls and text messages only from family (B) is not a valid criterion, as the technician may receive calls and text messages from other sources that are not related to the work or the customer. Responding to calls and text messages discreetly while on site (D) is not a good practice, as it can still be noticed by the customer or other personnel and create a negative impression.

## Question 168

Setting the connection to be metered is the best solution for limiting the amount of cellular data a user’s Windows 10 tablet can utilize when traveling. A metered connection is a network connection that has a data limit or charges fees based on the amount of data used. Windows 10 allows users to set any network connection as metered, which reduces the amount of data that Windows and some apps use in the background. For example, setting a connection as metered will prevent Windows from downloading updates automatically, stop some apps from syncing data online, and disable some live tiles on the Start menu. Setting a connection as metered can help users save cellular data and avoid extra charges when traveling. Turning on airplane mode, configuring the device to use a static IP address, and enabling the Windows Defender Firewall are not effective solutions for limiting the amount of cellular data a user’s Windows 10 tablet can utilize when traveling. Turning on airplane mode will disable all wireless connections on the device, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular data. This will prevent the user from accessing any online services or applications on the tablet. Configuring the device to use a static IP address will assign a fixed IP address to the device instead of obtaining one dynamically from a DHCP server. This will not affect the amount of cellular data the device uses, and it may cause IP conflicts or connectivity issues on some networks. Enabling the Windows Defender Firewall will block or allow incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined or custom rules. This will not reduce the amount of cellular data the device uses, and it may interfere with some apps or services that require network access. -

**A.** Document the date and time of the change.

**B.** Submit a change request form

**C.** Determine the risk level of this change

**D.** Request an unused IP address.

**D.** Operating system update

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

Outlook, that may prevent them from opening or working properly. This can happen if the update changes some system files or settings that Outlook relies on, or if the update conflicts with some Outlook add-ins or extensions. To fix this, the technician can try some of these troubleshooting steps: - Start Outlook in safe mode and disable add-ins. Safe mode is a way of starting Outlook without any add-ins or extensions that may interfere with its functionality. To start Outlook in safe mode, press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Outlook icon. You should see a message asking if you want to start Outlook in safe mode. Click Yes. If Outlook works fine in safe mode, it means one of the add-ins is causing the problem. To disable add-ins, go to File > Options > Add-ins. In the Manage drop-down list, select COM Add-ins and click Go. Uncheck any add-ins that you don’t need and click OK. Restart Outlook normally and check if the issue is resolved. - Create a new Outlook profile. A profile is a set of settings and information that Outlook uses to manage your email accounts and data. Sometimes, a profile can get corrupted or damaged and cause Outlook to malfunction. To create a new profile, go to Control Panel > Mail > Show Profiles. Click Add and follow the instructions to set up a new profile with your email account. Make sure to select the option to use the new profile as the default one. Restart Outlook and check if the issue is resolved. - Repair your Outlook data files. Data files are files that store your email messages, contacts, calendar events, and other items on your computer. Sometimes, data files can get corrupted or damaged and cause Outlook to malfunction. To repair your data files, you can use a tool called scanpst.exe, which is located in the same folder where Outlook is installed (usually C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16). To use scanpst.exe, close Outlook and locate the tool in the folder. Double-click on it and browse to the location of your data file (usually C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook). Select the file and click Start to begin the scanning and repairing process. When it’s done, restart Outlook and check if the issue is resolved. - Run the /resetnavpane command. The navigation pane is the panel on the left side of Outlook that shows your folders and accounts. Sometimes, the navigation pane can get corrupted or damaged and cause Outlook to malfunction. To reset the navigation pane, press Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box, or open the Command Prompt. Type outlook.exe /resetnavpane and hit Enter. This will clear and regenerate the navigation pane settings for Outlook. Restart Outlook and check if the issue is resolved.

The end users report that traffic to certain internal environments is not stable and often drops. Which of the following command-line tools can provide the most detailed information for investigating the issue further?

**A.** ipconfig

**B.** arp

**C.** nslookup

**D.** pathping

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

Pathping is the best command-line tool to provide the most detailed information for investigating the network performance issues. Pathping is a utility that combines the functions of ping and tracert, which are two other command-line tools that test network connectivity and latency. Pathping sends packets to each router on the path to a destination and then computes results based on the packets returned from each hop. Pathping can show the route taken by the packets, the number of hops, the latency of each hop, and the packet loss percentage. This information can help the systems administrator identify where the network problem occurs and how severe it is. Ipconfig, arp, and nslookup are not as useful as pathping for this task. Ipconfig shows the configuration of the network interface card, such as IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. Arp shows the mapping of IP addresses to MAC addresses in the local network. Nslookup queries DNS servers for domain name resolution. - Official CompTIA learning resources CompTIA A+ Core 1 and Core 2, page 21 - CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1101) and Core 2 (220-1102) Cert Guide, page 457

Keyboard Mobile device multifactor authentication (MFA) is a method of verifying a user’s identity by requiring two or more factors, such as something the user knows (e.g., password, PIN, security question), something the user has (e.g., smartphone, OTP app, security key), or something the user is (e.g., fingerprint, face, iris). The combination of fingerprint and password meets the requirements for mobile device MFA because it uses two different factors: something the user is (fingerprint) and something the user knows (password). The other combinations do not meet the requirements because they use only one factor: something the user knows (password or PIN) or something the user does (swipe).

## Question 239

A developer reports that a workstation's database file extensions have been changed from .db to .enc. The developer is also unable to open the database files manually. Which of the following is the best option for recovering the data?

**A.** Accessing a restore point

**B.** Rebooting into safe mode

**C.** Utilizing the backups

**D.** Using an AV to scan the affected files

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

The best option for recovering the data is to utilize the backups, assuming that the backups are recent, valid, and not affected by the ransomware. Backups are copies of the data that are stored in a separate location or device, and can be used to restore the data in case of a disaster, such as a ransomware attack. By restoring the data from the backups, the developer can avoid paying the ransom and losing the data permanently. Accessing a restore point is not a good option, because restore points are snapshots of the system settings and configuration, not the data files. Restore points can help to undo some system changes, such as installing a faulty driver or software, but they cannot recover the encrypted data files. Rebooting into safe mode is also not a good option, because safe mode is a diagnostic mode that allows the system to run with minimal drivers and services, but it does not affect the data files. Safe mode can help to troubleshoot some system issues, such as malware infections, but it cannot decrypt the data files. Using an AV to scan the affected files is also not a good option, because an AV is a software that can detect and remove some malware, but it cannot decrypt the data files. An AV can help to prevent or remove some ransomware infections, but it cannot recover the encrypted data files.

## Question 260

A workstation. The technician can use User Accounts to grant local administrative access to a user by adding the user to the Administrators group. The Administrators group has full control over the workstation and can perform tasks such as installing software, changing system settings, and accessing all files. A user receives an error message from an online banking site that states the following: Your connection is not private. Authority invalid. Which of the following actions should the user take NEXT?

**A.** Proceed to the site.

**B.** Use a different browser.

**C.** Report the error to the bank.

**D.** Reinstall the browser.

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

The error message “Your connection is not private. Authority invalid.” means that the web browser cannot verify the identity or security of the website’s SSL certificate. This could indicate that the website has been compromised, has a configuration error, or has an expired or invalid certificate. The user should not proceed to the site or use a different browser, as this could expose their sensitive information to potential attackers. The user should also not reinstall the browser, as this is unlikely to fix the error and could cause data loss. The best action for the user to take is to report the error to the bank and wait for them to resolve it.

## Question 262

256 the ISO means creating a virtual drive that can access the ISO file as if it were a physical disc. Running the installation file means executing the setup program that will install the program on the computer. A company implemented a BYOD policy and would like to reduce data disclosure caused by malware that may infect these devices. Which of the following should the company deploy to address these concerns?

**A.** UAC

**B.** MDM

**C.** LDAP

**D.** SSO

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

MDM stands for mobile device management, which is a type of software solution that allows remote management and security of mobile devices. MDM can help a company reduce data disclosure caused by malware that may infect these devices by enforcing security policies, such as encryption, password protection, antivirus software, and remote wipe. MDM can also monitor and control the access of personal devices to corporate data and networks. UAC stands for user account control, which is a feature of Windows that prompts users for permission or an administrator password before making changes that affect the system. UAC may not be effective in preventing malware infection or data disclosure on personal devices. LDAP stands for lightweight directory access protocol, which is a protocol for accessing and managing information stored in a directory service, such as user names and passwords. LDAP does not directly address the issue of malware infection or data disclosure on personal devices. SSO stands for single sign-on, which is a feature that allows users to access multiple applications or services with one set of credentials. SSO may not prevent malware infection or data disclosure on personal devices, and may even increase the risk if the credentials are compromised. https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2021/03/mobile-device-security-bring-your-own-device-byod-draft-sp-1800-22 A change advisory board did not approve a requested change due to the lack of alternative actions if implementation failed.

## Question 265

Verified References: 261 https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204306 https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a An employee calls the help desk regarding an issue with a laptop PC. After a Windows update, the user can no longer use certain locally attached devices, and a reboot has not fixed the issue. Which of the following should the technician perform to fix the issue?

**A.** Disable the Windows Update service.

**B.** Check for updates.

**C.** Restore hidden updates.

**D.** Rollback updates.

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

The technician should perform a rollback of the Windows update that caused the issue with the locally attached devices. A rollback is a process of uninstalling an update and restoring the previous version of the system. This can help to fix any compatibility or performance issues caused by the update1. To rollback an update, the technician can use the Settings app, the Control Panel, or the System Restore feature. The technician should also check for any device driver updates that might be needed after rolling back the update. Disabling the Windows Update service is not a good practice, as it can prevent the system from receiving important security and feature updates. Checking for updates might not fix the issue, as the update that caused the issue might still be installed. Restoring hidden updates is not relevant, as it only applies to updates that have been hidden by the user to prevent them from being installed2. - 1: https://www.windowscentral.com/how-uninstall-and-reinstall-updates-windows-10 - 2: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-or-hide-updates-in-windows-10-9c9f0a4f-9a6e-4c8e-8b44-afbc6b33f3cf When a user calls in to report an issue, a technician submits a ticket on the user's behalf.

## Question 268

An implementation specialist is replacing a legacy system at a vendor site that has only one wireless When the specialist connects to Wi-Fi, the specialist realizes the insecure network has open authentication. The technician needs to secure the vendor's sensitive data. Which of the following should the specialist do FIRST to protect the company's data?

**A.** Manually configure an IP address, a subnet mask, and a default gateway.

**B.** Connect to the vendor's network using a VPN.

**C.** Change the network location to private.

**D.** Configure MFA on the network.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

The first thing that the specialist should do to protect the company’s data on an insecure network with open authentication is to connect to the vendor’s network using a VPN. A VPN stands for Virtual Private Network and is a technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection over a public or untrusted network. A VPN can protect the company’s data by preventing eavesdropping, interception or modification of the network traffic by unauthorized parties. A VPN can also provide access to the company’s internal network and resources remotely. Manually configuring an IP address, a subnet mask and a default gateway may not be necessary or possible if the vendor’s network uses DHCP to assign network configuration parameters automatically. Manually configuring an IP address, a subnet mask and a default gateway does not protect the company’s data from network attacks or threats. Changing the network location to private may not be advisable or effective if the vendor’s network is a public or untrusted network. Changing the network location to private does not protect the company’s data from network attacks or threats. Configuring MFA on the network may not be feasible or sufficient if the vendor’s network has open authentication and does not support or require MFA. Configuring MFA on the network does not protect the company’s data from network attacks or threats.

A warning message in the user's browser states the site's certificate cannot be verified. Which of the following is the most appropriate action for a technician to take?

**A.** Click proceed.

**B.** Report the employee to the human resources department for violating company policy.

**C.** Restore the computer from the last known backup.

**D.** Close the browser window and report the email to IT security.

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

A warning message in the user’s browser stating the site’s certificate cannot be verified indicates that the site may be insecure, fraudulent, or malicious. This could be a sign of a phishing attempt, where the sender of the email tries to trick the user into clicking a link that leads to a fake website that mimics a legitimate one, in order to steal the user’s personal or financial information. The most appropriate action is to close the browser window and report the email to IT security. The action for a technician to take in this situation is to close the browser window and report the email to IT security, who can investigate the source and content of the email, and take the necessary steps to protect the user and the network from potential harm. Clicking proceed could expose the user to malware, identity theft, or data breach. Reporting the employee to the human resources department for violating company policy is unnecessary and harsh, as the user may not have been aware of the phishing attempt or the company policy. Restoring the computer from the last known backup is premature and ineffective, as the user may not have been infected by anything, and the backup may not remove the email or the link from the user’s inbox.

## Question 276

VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a remote access tool that allows the technician to access and control various Windows, Linux, and macOS desktops on the company LAN using a graphical user interface. VNC does not require an external internet connection, as it works over a local network or a VPN. VNC uses a client-server model, where the server runs on the remote desktop and the client connects to it from another device. VNC can transmit the keyboard and mouse events from the client to the server, and the screen updates from the server to the client, enabling the technician to interact with the remote desktop as if it were local12. VNC is a better option than the other choices because: - RMM (Remote Monitoring and Management) (B) is not a single software solution, but a category of software solutions that enable IT professionals to remotely monitor, manage, and troubleshoot multiple devices and networks. RMM software may include remote access tools, but also other features such as patch management, backup and recovery, security, reporting, and automation. RMM software may require an external internet connection, as it often relies on cloud-based services or web-based consoles34. - RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) (C) is a remote access tool that allows the technician to access and control Windows desktops on the company LAN using a graphical user interface. However, RDP is not compatible with Linux or macOS desktops, unless they have third-party software installed that can emulate or translate the RDP protocol. RDP also has some security and performance issues, such as encryption vulnerabilities, bandwidth consumption, and latency problems56. - SSH (Secure Shell) (D) is a remote access tool that allows the technician to access and control various Windows, Linux, and macOS desktops on the company LAN using a command-line interface. SSH does not require an external internet connection, as it works over a local network or a VPN. SSH uses encryption and authentication to secure the communication between the client and the server. However, SSH does not provide a graphical user interface, which may limit the functionality and usability of the remote desktop7. 1: What is VNC? - Definition from Techopedia1 2: How VNC Works - RealVNC2 3: What is Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM)? - Definition from Techopedia3 4: What is RMM Software? - NinjaRMM4 5: What is Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)? - Definition from Techopedia5 6: Remote

The first thing that a support technician should check to resolve the issue of not being able to receive emails or browse the internet from a smartphone while traveling is the data plan coverage. The data plan coverage determines how much data and where the user can use on the smartphone’s cellular network. The data plan coverage may vary depending on the user’s location, carrier and subscription. The data plan coverage may not include or support certain areas or countries that the user is traveling to, or may charge extra fees or limit the speed or amount of data that the user can use. The data plan coverage does not affect text messages and phone calls, which use different network services and protocols. User account status is not likely to cause the issue of not being able to receive emails or browse the internet from a smartphone while traveling, unless the user account has been suspended or terminated by the carrier or the email provider. Mobile OS version is not likely to cause the issue of not being able to receive emails or browse the internet from a smartphone while traveling, unless the mobile OS has a major bug or compatibility problem with the network or the email app. Network traffic outages may cause the issue of not being able to receive emails or browse the internet from a smartphone while traveling, but they are less likely and less common than data plan coverage issues, and they should also affect text messages and phone calls.

## Question 287

Before making any changes to the system, it is important to assess the risks associated with the change and determine whether it is worth implementing. Risk analysis involves identifying potential risks, assessing their likelihood and impact, and determining what steps can be taken to mitigate them. It is important to perform this step before making any changes, as this allows the administrator to make an informed decision about whether or not the change should be implemented. Once the risks have been assessed and the administrator has decided to go ahead with the change, the next step is to implement the deployment.

**A.** WPS

**B.** WPA3

**C.** WEP

**D.** WMN

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

The strongest wireless configuration is B. WPA3. WPA3 is the most up-to-date wireless encryption protocol and is the most secure choice. It replaces PSK with SAE, a more secure way to do the initial key exchange. At the same time, the session key size of WPA3 increases to 128-bit in WPA3-Personal mode and 192-bit in WPA3-Enterprise, which makes the password harder to crack than the previous Wi-Fi security standards. https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/wep-wpa-wpa2-wpa3-explained/ A. ipconfig B. ifconfig C. arpa D. ping

**A.** ipconfig

**B.** ifconfig

**C.** arpa

**D.** ping

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

ifconfig is a command-line utility that allows you to configure network interfaces on macOS and other Unix-like systems. To set an IP address using ifconfig, you need to know the name of the network interface you want to configure (such as en0 or en1), and the IP address you want to assign (such as ... sudo ifconfig interface address For example, to set the IP address of en1 to 192.168.0.150, you would type: sudo ifconfig en1 192.168.0.150 You may also need to specify other parameters such as subnet mask, gateway, or DNS servers, depending on your network configuration. The other commands are not directly related to setting an IP address on macOS. ipconfig is a similar command for Windows systems, arpa is a domain name used for reverse DNS lookup, and ping is a command for testing network connectivity.

## Question 290

A field technician applied a Group Policy setting to all the workstations in the network. This setting forced the workstations to use a specific SNTP server. Users are unable to log in now. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause of this issue?

**A.** The SNTP server is offline.

**B.** A user changed the time zone on a local machine.

**C.** The Group Policy setting has disrupted domain authentication on the system.

**D.** The workstations and the authentication server have a system clock difference.

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

The workstations and the authentication server have a system clock difference. If a Group Policy setting is applied that forces the workstations to use a specific SNTP server, but the system clock on the workstations and the authentication server are out of sync, then this can cause authentication issues and users will be unable to log in. In this case, the most likely cause of the issue is a difference in system clocks and the technician should ensure that the clocks on the workstations and the authentication server are in sync. The technician attempts to boot the computer via the NIC to image the computer, but this method does not work. Which of the following is the MOST likely reason the computer is unable to boot into the imaging system via the network? - A. The computer's CMOS battery failed. - B. The computer's NIC is faulty. - C. The PXE boot option has not been enabled - D. The Ethernet cable the technician is using to connect the desktop to the network is faulty.

A technician is reimaging a desktop PC. The technician connects the PC to the network and powers it on. The technician attempts to boot the computer via the NIC to image the computer, but this method does not work. Which of the following is the MOST likely reason the computer is unable to boot into the imaging system via the network?

**A.** The computer's CMOS battery failed.

**B.** The computer's NIC is faulty.

**C.** The PXE boot option has not been enabled

**D.** The Ethernet cable the technician is using to connect the desktop to the network is faulty.

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

The most likely reason the computer is unable to boot into the imaging system via the network is that the PXE boot option has not been enabled. PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) is an environment that allows computers to boot up over the network, instead of from a local disk. In order for this to work, the PXE boot option must be enabled in the computer's BIOS settings. As stated in the CompTIA A+ Core 2 exam objectives, technicians should know how to enable PXE in BIOS to enable network booting on a computer. - A. ipconfig /all - B. hostname - C. netstat /? - D. nslookup localhost - E. arp —a - F. ping :: 1 Answer: A, B The user can use the following commands to give the technician the correct information: ipconfig /all and hostname.

## Question 296

An EULA (End-User License Agreement) is a legally binding contract between a software supplier and a customer or end-user, generally made available to the customer via a retailer acting as an intermediary. A EULA specifies in detail the rights and restrictions which apply to the use of the software. Some of the main terms included in an EULA are the terms and scope of the license, any licensing fees, warranties and disclaimers, limitation of liability, revocation or termination of the license, and intellectual property information and restrictions on using the license (e.g. modification and copying). https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/eula-vs-terms-conditions/ malware. Which of the following will MOST likely help to permanently remove the malware?

**A.** Enabling System Restore

**B.** Educating the user

**C.** Booting into safe mode

**D.** Scheduling a scan

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

Although updating the anti-malware software and running scans are important steps in removing malware, they may not be sufficient to permanently remove the malware if the user keeps engaging in behaviors that leave the system vulnerable, such as downloading unknown files or visiting malicious websites. Therefore, educating the user on safe computing practices is the best way to prevent future infections and permanently remove the malware. Enabling System Restore, Booting into safe mode, and scheduling a scan are not the most efficient ways to permanently remove the malware. Enabling System Restore and Booting into safe mode may help in some cases, but they may not be sufficient to permanently remove the malware. Scheduling a scan is also important for detecting and removing malware, but it may not be sufficient to prevent future infections. https://partners.comptia.org/docs/default-source/resources/comptia-a-220-1102-exam-objectives-(3-0) - A.

## Question 297

A company recently outsourced its night-shift cleaning service. A technician is concerned about having unsupervised contractors in the building. Which of the following security measures can be used to prevent the computers from being accessed? (Select two). - A. Implementing data-at-rest encryption - B. Disabling AutoRun - C. Restricting user permissions - D. Restricting log-in times - E. Enabling a screen lock - F. Disabling local administrator accounts Answer: D,E The correct answers are D. Restricting log-in times and E. Enabling a screen lock. These are the security measures that can be used to prevent the computers from being accessed by unsupervised. contractors in the building. - Restricting log-in times means setting a policy that allows users to log in only during certain hours, such as the regular working hours of the company. This will prevent unauthorized access by contractors who work at night1. - Enabling a screen lock means setting a policy that requires users to enter a password or a PIN to unlock their screens after a period of inactivity. This will prevent unauthorized access by contractors who might try to use the computers when the users are away2. 1: Objectives, page 19, section 2.3. 2: Objectives, page 20, section 2.4. A remote user's smartphone is performing very slowly. The user notices that the performance improves slightly after rebooting but then reverts back to performing slowly. The user also notices that the phone does not get any faster after connecting to the company's corporate guest network. A technician sees that the phone has a large number of applications installed on it. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the issue?

**A.** The user is in a poor signal area.

**B.** The user has too many processes running.

**C.** The smartphone has malware on it.

**D.** The smartphone has been jailbroken.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

One of the common reasons for a slow smartphone performance is having too many apps installed and running in the background. These apps consume the device’s memory (RAM) and CPU resources, which can affect the speed and responsiveness of the phone. Rebooting the phone can temporarily clear the RAM and stop some background processes, but they may resume after a while. Connecting to a different network does not affect the performance of the phone, unless the network is congested or has a poor signal. The user can improve the phone’s performance by uninstalling unused apps, clearing app caches, and restricting background activities12. Malware can also slow down a phone, but it is not the most likely cause in this scenario, as the user does not report any other symptoms of infection, such as pop-ups, battery drain, or data usage spikes3. Jailbreaking a phone can also affect its performance, but it is not a cause, rather a consequence, of the user’s actions. Jailbreaking is the process of removing the manufacturer’s restrictions on a phone, which allows the user to install unauthorized apps, customize the system, and access root privileges4. However, jailbreaking also exposes the phone to security risks, voids the warranty, and may cause instability or compatibility issues5.

**A.** Corporate

**B.** Perpetual

**C.** Open-source

**D.** Personal

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

A corporate EULA is a type of end-user license agreement that is designed for a large organization that needs to use proprietary software with vendor support for a multiuser environment. A corporate EULA typically grants the organization a volume license that allows it to install and use the software on multiple devices or servers, and to distribute the software to its employees or affiliates. A corporate EULA also usually provides the organization with technical support, maintenance, updates, and warranty from the software vendor, as well as some customization options and discounts. A corporate EULA may also include terms and conditions that specify the rights and obligations of both parties, such as confidentiality, liability, indemnification, termination, and dispute resolution12. A corporate EULA is a better option than the other choices because: - ✑ A perpetual EULA (B) is a type of end-user license agreement that grants the user a permanent and irrevocable license to use the software, without any time limit or expiration date. However, a perpetual EULA does not necessarily include vendor support, updates, or warranty, and it may not allow the user to install the software on multiple devices or servers, or to distribute the software to other users. A perpetual EULA may also be more expensive than a corporate EULA, as it requires a one-time payment upfront, rather than a recurring subscription fee34. An open-source EULA is a type of end-user license agreement that grants the user a license to use, modify, and redistribute the software, which is publicly available and free of charge. However, an open-source EULA does not provide any vendor support, maintenance, updates, or warranty, and it may impose some restrictions or obligations on the user, such as disclosing the source code, attributing the original author, or using a compatible license for derivative works. An open-source EULA may not be suitable for a large organization that needs proprietary software with vendor support for a multiuser environment.

## Question 311

User access control, UEFI boot mode, and log-on times are not likely causes of the issue. User access control is a feature that prevents unauthorized changes to the system by prompting for confirmation or credentials. UEFI boot mode is a firmware interface that controls the boot process of the workstation. Log-on times are settings that restrict when a user can log in to the workstation. None of these factors affect the validity of the certificates used by websites. - Official CompTIA learning resources CompTIA A+ Core 1 and Core 2, page 14 - CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1101) and Core 2 (220-1102) Cert Guide, page 456

## Question 312

Management Service (KMS)1. KMS is a method of activation that uses a local server to activate multiple devices on a network. KMS activations are valid for 180 days and need to be renewed periodically by connecting to the KMS server2. If a device does not renew its activation within 180 days, it will enter a grace period of 30 days, after which it will display a warning message and lose some functionality until it is reactivated3. The other editions of Windows 10 do not require reactivation every 180 days. Windows 10 Pro for Workstation is an edition of Windows 10 that is designed for high-performance devices that need advanced features such as ReFS file system, persistent memory, and faster file sharing. Windows 10 Pro for Workstation can be activated using a digital license or a product key. Windows 10 Home is an edition of Windows 10 that is designed for personal or home use. Windows 10 Home can be activated using a digital license or a product key. Windows 10 Pro is an edition of Windows 10 that is designed for business or professional use. Windows 10 Pro can be activated using a digital license or a product key. None of these editions require reactivation every 180 days unless there are significant hardware changes or other issues that affect the activation status. Which of the following environments allows for the testing of critical systems without the risk of them being negatively impacted by changes?

**A.** Regression

**B.** Cloud

**C.** Production

**D.** Sandbox

**Answer:** D

## Question 313

https://www.comptia.org/training/books/a-core-2-220-1102-study-guide A network technician installed a SOHO router for a home office user. The user has read reports about home routers being targeted by malicious actors and then used in DDoS attacks. Which of the following can the technician MOST likely do to defend against this threat?

**A.** Add network content filtering.

**B.** Disable the SSID broadcast.

**C.** Configure port forwarding.

**D.** Change the default credentials.

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

One of the most effective ways to defend against malicious actors targeting home routers for DDoS attacks is to change the default credentials of the router. The default credentials are often well-known or easily guessed by attackers, who can then access and compromise the router settings and firmware. By changing the default credentials to strong and unique ones, a technician can prevent unauthorized access and configuration changes to the router. Adding network content filtering may help block some malicious or unwanted websites but may not prevent attackers from exploiting router vulnerabilities or backdoors. Disabling the SSID broadcast may help reduce the visibility of the wireless network but may not prevent attackers from scanning or detecting it. Configuring port forwarding may help direct incoming traffic to specific devices or services but may not prevent attackers from sending malicious packets or requests to the router.
