1. An engineer is configuring a new server that requires a bare-metal installation. Which of the following installation methods should the engineer use if installation media is not available on site?

- A. Image deployment
- B. Recovery partition installation
- C. Remote network installation
- D. Repair installation

Answer: C

# Explanation:

Remote network installation is the best option for configuring a new server that requires a bare-metal installation without installation media on site. A remote network installation is a method of installing an operating system or an application over a network connection, such as LAN, WAN, or Internet. A remote network installation can use various protocols, such as PXE, HTTP, FTP, or SMB, to access the installation files from a server or a cloud service. A remote network installation can also use various tools, such as Windows Deployment Services, Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, or Red Hat Kickstart, to automate and customize the installation process. A remote network installation can save time and resources by eliminating the need for physical media and allowing centralized management of multiple installations.

Image deployment, recovery partition installation, and repair installation are not correct answers for this question. Image deployment is a method of installing an operating system or an application by copying a preconfigured image file to a target device. Image deployment requires an existing image file and a compatible device. Recovery partition installation is a method of restoring an operating system or an application from a hidden partition on the hard disk that contains the original factory settings. Recovery partition installation requires an existing recovery partition and a functional hard disk. Repair installation is a method of fixing an operating system or an application that is corrupted or damaged by replacing or repairing the system files without affecting the user data or settings. Repair installation requires an existing operating system or application and a working device.

6. A customer calls desktop support and begins yelling at a technician. The customer claims to have submitted a support ticket two hours ago and complains that the issue still has not been resolved. Which of the following describes how the technician should respond?

- A. Place the customer on hold until the customer calms down.
- B. Disconnect the call to avoid a confrontation.
- C. Wait until the customer is done speaking and offer assistance.
- D. Escalate the issue to a supervisor.

Answer: C

Explanation: The best way to deal with an angry customer who is yelling at a technician is to wait until the customer is done speaking and offer assistance. This shows respect, empathy, and professionalism, and allows the technician to understand the customer’s problem and find a solution. According to the CompTIA A+ Core 2 (220-1102) Certification Study Guide1, some of the steps to handle angry customers are:

- Stay calm and do not take it personally.
- Listen actively and acknowledge the customer’s feelings.
- Apologize sincerely and offer to help.
- Restate the customer’s issue and ask for clarification if needed.
- Explain the possible causes and solutions for the problem.
- Provide clear and realistic expectations for the resolution.
- Follow up with the customer until the issue is resolved.

The other options are not appropriate ways to deal with angry customers, as they may worsen the situation or damage the customer relationship. Placing the customer on hold may make them feel ignored or dismissed. Disconnecting the call may make them feel disrespected or abandoned. Escalating the issue to a supervisor may make them feel frustrated or powerless, unless the technician cannot resolve the issue or the customer requests to speak to a supervisor.

B. Removing the applications from startup

C. Installing a faster SSD

D. Running the Disk Cleanup utility

E. Defragmenting the hard drive

F. Ending the processes in the Task Manager

Answer: B,D

Explanation: Removing the applications from startup can improve the boot time of a PC by reducing the number of programs that load automatically when the PC starts. Some applications may add themselves to the startup list without the user’s knowledge or consent, which can slow down the PC’s performance.

Sandbox testing is a method of testing changes in a simulated environment that mimics the real one, without affecting the actual production system. Sandbox testing is useful for change management because it allows the testers to evaluate the change before deployment, and ensure that it works as intended, does not cause any errors or conflicts, and meets the requirements and expectations of the stakeholders.

Sandbox testing also helps to protect the investment in the existing system, as it reduces the risk of introducing bugs or breaking functionality that could harm the customer experience or the business operations. Sandbox testing also gives the testers more control over the customer experience, as they can experiment with different scenarios and configurations, and optimize the change for the best possible outcome.

A user is unable to access a web-based application. A technician verifies the computer cannot access any web pages at all. The computer obtains an IP address from the DHCP server. Then, the technician verifies the user can ping localhost, the gateway, and known IP addresses on the internet and receive a response. Which of the following is the MOST likely reason for the issue?

- A. A firewall is blocking the application.
- B. The wrong VLAN was assigned.
- C. The incorrect DNS address was assigned.
- D. The browser cache needs to be cleared.

Answer: C

Explanation: DNS (domain name system) is a protocol that translates domain names to IP addresses. If the computer has an incorrect DNS address assigned, it will not be able to resolve the domain names of web-based applications and access them. A firewall, a VLAN (virtual local area network) and a browser cache are not the most likely reasons for the issue, since the computer can ping known IP addresses on the internet and receive a response.

Certify For Sure with IT Exam Dumps

B. Pro

C. Pro for Workstations

D. Enterprise

Answer: D

Explanation:

When selecting a new Windows operating system for a large company that needs built-in encryption and endpoint protection, the Enterprise edition is the most likely choice.

30. A technician wants to install Developer Mode on a Windows laptop but is receiving a "failed to install package" message. Which of the following should the technician do first?

- A. Ensure internet connectivity.
- B. Check for Windows updates.
- C. Enable SSH.
- D. Reboot computer.

Answer: A

Explanation:

Developer Mode on Windows 10 is a feature that allows developers to test and debug their applications on their devices, as well as sideload apps and access other developer tools. To enable Developer Mode, the user needs to go to the Settings app, select Update &#x26; Security, choose For Developers, and switch to Developer Mode. However, enabling Developer Mode requires internet connectivity, as Windows will download and install a package of features, such as Windows Device Portal and SSH services, that are necessary for Developer Mode. If the user does not have internet connectivity, they will receive a “failed to install package” message when trying to enable Developer Mode. Therefore, the first thing that the technician should do is to ensure that the laptop has internet access, either through Wi-Fi or Ethernet, and then try to enable Developer Mode again.

# 32. Which of the following is used to explain issues that may occur during a change implementation?

- A. Scope change
- B. End-user acceptance
- C. Risk analysis
- D. Rollback plan

Answer: C

# Explanation:

Risk analysis is used to explain issues that may occur during a change implementation. Risk analysis is a process of identifying, assessing and prioritizing potential risks that may affect a project or an activity. Risk analysis can help determine the likelihood and impact of various issues that may arise during a change implementation, such as technical errors, compatibility problems, security breaches, performance degradation or user dissatisfaction. Risk analysis can also help plan and prepare for mitigating or avoiding these issues. Scope change is a modification of the original goals, requirements or deliverables of a project or an activity. Scope change is not used to explain issues that may occur during a change implementation but to reflect changes in expectations or needs of the stakeholders. End-user acceptance is a measure of how well the users are satisfied with and adopt a new system or service. End-user acceptance is not used to explain issues that may occur during a change implementation but to evaluate the success and effectiveness of the change. Rollback plan is a contingency plan that describes how to restore a system or service to its previous state in case of a failed or problematic change implementation. Rollback plan is not used to explain issues that may occur during a change implementation but to recover from them.

34. A company would like to implement multifactor authentication for all employees at a minimal cost.

Which of the following best meets the company's requirements?

- A. Biometrics
- B. Soft token
- C. Access control lists
- D. Smart card

Answer: B

Explanation: A soft token, also known as a software token or an OTP (one-time password) app, is a type of multifactor authentication that generates a temporary code or password on a user’s device, such as a smartphone or a tablet. The user must enter this code or password along with their username and password to access their account or service. A soft token can help improve security by adding an extra layer of verification and preventing unauthorized access even if the user’s credentials are compromised. A soft token can also be implemented at a minimal cost, as it does not require any additional hardware or infrastructure. Biometrics, access control lists, and smart card are not types of multifactor authentication that can be implemented at a minimal cost.

35. A network technician is deploying a new machine in a small branch office that does not have a DHCP server. The new machine automatically receives the IP address of 169.254.0.2 and is unable to communicate with the rest of the network. Which of the following would restore communication?

- A. Static entry
- B. ARP table
- C. APIPA address
- D. NTP specification

The No.1 IT Certification Dumps

# Certify For Sure with IT Exam Dumps

Answer: A

Explanation: A static entry is the best option to restore communication for the new machine in a small branch office that does not have a DHCP server. A static entry means manually configuring the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server for the network adapter of the machine. A static entry ensures that the machine has a valid and unique IP address that matches the network configuration and can communicate with the rest of the network.

The new machine automatically receives the IP address of 169.254.0.2 because it uses APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing), which is a feature that enables computers to self-assign an IP address when a DHCP server is not available. However, APIPA only works for local communication within the same subnet, and does not provide a default gateway or a DNS server. Therefore, the new machine is unable to communicate with the rest of the network, which may be on a different subnet or require a gateway or a DNS server to access.

The other options are not related to restoring communication for the new machine. ARP table is a cache that stores the mapping between IP addresses and MAC addresses for the devices on the network. NTP specification is a protocol that synchronizes the clocks of the devices on the network.

A user's corporate laptop with proprietary work information was stolen from a coffee shop. The user logged in to the laptop with a simple password, and no other security mechanisms were in place. Which of the following would MOST likely prevent the stored data from being recovered?

- A. Biometrics
- B. Full disk encryption
- C. Enforced strong system password
- D. Two-factor authentication

Answer: B

Explanation: Full disk encryption is a security mechanism that encrypts the entire data on a hard drive, making it unreadable without the correct decryption key or password. It can prevent the stored data from being recovered by unauthorized persons who steal or access the laptop. Biometrics, enforced strong system password and two-factor authentication are other security mechanisms, but they only protect the login access to the laptop, not the data on the hard drive.

A technician needs to perform after-hours service starting at 10:00 p.m. The technician is currently 20 minutes late. The customer will also be late. Which of the following should the technician do considering proper communication techniques and professionalism?

- A. Do not notify the customer if arriving before the customer.
- B. Dismiss the customer and proceed with the after-hours work.
- C. Contact the customer if the technician is arriving late.
- D. Disclose the experience via social media.

Answer: C

# Explanation:

The best option for the technician to demonstrate proper communication techniques and professionalism is to contact the customer if the technician is arriving late. This shows respect for the customer’s time and expectations, and allows the customer to adjust their schedule accordingly. It also helps to maintain a positive relationship and trust between the technician and the customer. The technician should apologize for the delay and provide a realistic estimate of their arrival time. The technician should also thank the customer for their patience and understanding.

The other options are not appropriate or professional. Do not notify the customer if arriving before the customer is not a good practice, as it may cause confusion or frustration for the customer. The customer may have made other plans or arrangements based on the technician’s original schedule, and may not be available or prepared for the service. Dismiss the customer and proceed with the after-hours work is rude and disrespectful, as it ignores the customer’s needs and preferences. The customer may have questions or concerns about the service, or may want to supervise or verify the work. The technician should always communicate with the customer before, during, and after the service.

Disclose the experience via social media is unethical and unprofessional, as it may violate the customer’s privacy and the company’s policies. The technician should not share any confidential or sensitive information about the customer or the service on social media, or make any negative or inappropriate comments about the customer or the situation.

Therefore, if NFC is disabled on the phone, the payment will not work. To enable NFC on an Android phone, you need to follow these steps3:

- On your Android device, open the Settings app.
- Select Connected devices.
- Tap on Connection preferences.
- You should see the NFC option. Toggle it on.

The other options are not directly related to using a payment application with a mobile device. Airplane mode is a setting that disables all wireless communication on the phone, including NFC4, but it also affects calls, texts, and internet access. Bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows you to connect your phone with other devices such as headphones or speakers, but it is not used for contactless payments. Wi-Fi is a wireless technology that allows you to access the internet or a local network, but it is also not used for contactless payments. Location services are a feature that allows your phone to determine your geographic location using GPS or other methods, but they are not required for contactless payments.

A systems administrator is creating periodic backups of a folder on a Microsoft Windows machine. The source data is very dynamic, and files are either added or deleted regularly. Which of the following utilities can be used to ‘mirror the source data for the backup?

- A. copy
- B. xcopy
- C. robocopy
- D. Copy-Item

Answer: C

Explanation:

Robocopy is a command-line utility that can be used to mirror the source data for the backup. It can copy files and folders with various options, such as copying only changed files, preserving attributes and permissions, and retrying failed copies. Robocopy is more powerful and flexible than copy or xcopy, which are simpler commands that can only copy files and folders without mirroring or other advanced features.

Copy-Item is a PowerShell cmdlet that can also copy files and folders, but it is not a native Windows utility and it requires PowerShell to run.

A user rotates a cell phone horizontally to read emails, but the display remains vertical, even though the settings indicate autorotate is on. Which of the following will MOST likely resolve the issue?

- A. Recalibrating the magnetometer
- B. Recalibrating the compass
- C. Recalibrating the digitizer
- D. Recalibrating the accelerometer

Answer: D

Explanation: When a user rotates a cell phone horizontally to read emails and the display remains vertical, even though the settings indicate autorotate is on, this is typically due to a problem with the phone's accelerometer. The accelerometer is the sensor that detects changes in the phone's orientation and adjusts the display accordingly. If the accelerometer is not calibrated correctly, the display may not rotate as expected.

Recalibrating the accelerometer is the most likely solution to this issue. The process for recalibrating the accelerometer can vary depending on the specific device and operating system, but it typically involves going to the device's settings and finding the option to calibrate or reset the sensor. Users may need to search their device's documentation or online resources to find specific instructions for their device.

Certify For Sure with IT Exam Dumps

The correct answer is D. Unattended installation. An unattended installation is a way of installing Windows 10 without requiring any user input or interaction. It uses a configuration file called answer file that contains the settings and preferences for the installation, such as the product key, language, partition, and network settings. An unattended installation can be performed by using a bootable USB flash drive or DVD that contains the Windows 10 installation files and the answer file1. This is the fastest way for the technician to install Windows 10 on a newly built computer, as it automates the whole process and saves time. A factory reset is a way of restoring a computer to its original state by deleting all the data and applications and reinstalling the operating system. A factory reset can be performed by using the recovery partition or media that came with the computer, or by using the Reset this PC option in Windows 10 settings2. A factory reset is not a way of installing Windows 10 on a newly built computer, as it requires an existing operating system to be present.

A system restore is a way of undoing changes to a computer’s system files and settings by using a restore point that was created earlier. A system restore can be performed by using the System Restore option in Windows 10 settings or by using the Advanced Startup Options menu3. A system restore is not a way of installing Windows 10 on a newly built computer, as it requires an existing operating system and restore points to be present.

An in-place upgrade is a way of upgrading an existing operating system to a newer version without losing any data or applications. An in-place upgrade can be performed by using the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool or by running the Setup.exe file from the Windows 10 installation media. An in-place upgrade is not a way of installing Windows 10 on a newly built computer, as it requires an existing operating system to be present.

A developer's Type 2 hypervisor is performing inadequately when compiling new source code. Which of the following components should the developer upgrade to improve the hypervisor’s performance?

- A. Amount of system RAM
- B. NIC performance
- C. Storage IOPS
- D. Dedicated GPU

Answer: A

Explanation: The correct answer is A. Amount of system RAM. A Type 2 hypervisor is a virtualization software that runs on top of a host operating system, which means it shares the system resources with the host OS and other applications. Therefore, increasing the amount of system RAM can improve the performance of the hypervisor and the virtual machines running on it. RAM is used to store data and instructions that are frequently accessed by the CPU, and having more RAM can reduce the need for swapping data to and from the storage device, which is slower than RAM.

NIC performance, storage IOPS, and dedicated GPU are not as relevant for improving the hypervisor’s performance in this scenario. NIC performance refers to the speed and quality of the network interface card, which is used to connect the computer to a network. Storage IOPS refers to the number of input/output operations per second that can be performed by the storage device, which is a measure of its speed and efficiency. Dedicated GPU refers to a separate graphics processing unit that can handle complex graphics tasks, such as gaming or video editing. These components may affect other aspects of the computer’s performance, but they are not directly related to the hypervisor’s ability to compile new source code.

- A. Degaussing
- B. Standard formatting
- C. Low-level wiping
- D. Deleting

Answer: C

Explanation: Low-level wiping is the best data destruction method for recycling old hard drives for reuse. Low-level wiping is a process that overwrites every bit of data on a hard drive with zeros or random patterns, making it impossible to recover any data from the drive. Low-level wiping also restores the drive to its factory state, removing any bad sectors or errors that may have accumulated over time. Low-level wiping can be done using specialized software tools or hardware devices that connect to the drive. Degaussing, standard formatting, and deleting are not suitable data destruction methods for recycling old hard drives for reuse. Degaussing is a process that exposes a hard drive to a strong magnetic field, destroying both the data and the drive itself. Degaussing renders the drive unusable for reuse. Standard formatting is a process that erases the data on a hard drive by removing the file system structure, but it does not overwrite the data itself. Standard formatting leaves some data recoverable using forensic tools or software utilities. Deleting is a process that removes the data from a hard drive by marking it as free space, but it does not erase or overwrite the data itself. Deleting leaves most data recoverable using undelete tools or software utilities.

A software firewall can help prevent unauthorized LAN devices from accessing stored files on a company file server by applying rules and policies that filter the network packets.

# Explanation of RDP Connection

In order to connect to a user’s laptop via RDP, the technician should open port 3389 on the Windows firewall. This is because RDP uses port 3389 for communication12. The other options are not necessary or relevant for establishing an RDP connection.

- Confirming the user can ping the default gateway is not required for RDP, as it only tests the network connectivity between the user’s laptop and the router. RDP works over the internet, so the technician should be able to ping the user’s laptop directly using its IP address3.
- Changing the IP address on the user’s laptop is not needed for RDP, as long as the IP address is valid and not conflicting with another device on the network. The user’s laptop has a valid IP address of 192.168.0.45, which belongs to the same subnet as the gateway (192.168.0.1) and the subnet mask (255.255.255.0)4.
- Changing the subnet mask on the user’s laptop is not required for RDP, as long as the subnet mask matches the network configuration. The user’s laptop has a correct subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, which defines a network with 254 possible hosts4.

based on their source, destination, protocol, port, or content. A software firewall can also block or allow specific applications or services from communicating with the network, and alert the administrator of any suspicious or malicious activity12.

A software firewall is a better option than the other choices because:

- Password complexity (B) is a good practice to protect the file server from unauthorized access, but it is not sufficient by itself. Password complexity refers to the use of strong passwords that are hard to guess or crack by attackers, and that are changed frequently and securely. Password complexity can prevent brute force attacks or credential theft, but it cannot stop network attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the file server software or hardware, or that bypass the authentication process34.
- Antivirus application (C) and anti-malware scans (D) are important tools to protect the file server from viruses and malware that can infect, damage, or encrypt the stored files. However, they are not effective in preventing unauthorized LAN devices from accessing the files in the first place. Antivirus and anti-malware tools can only detect and remove known threats, and they may not be able to stop zero-day attacks or advanced persistent threats that can evade or disable them. Moreover, antivirus and anti-malware tools cannot control the network traffic or the file server permissions, and they may not be compatible with all file server platforms or configurations56.

A technician is unable to access the internet or named network resources. The technician receives a valid IP address from the DHCP server and can ping the default gateway. Which of the following should the technician check next to resolve the issue?

- A. Verify the DNS server settings.
- B. Turn off the Windows firewall.
- C. Confirm the subnet mask is correct.
- D. Configure a static IP address.

Answer: A

Explanation:

The correct answer is A. Verify the DNS server settings. This is because the DNS server is responsible for resolving domain names to IP addresses, which is necessary for accessing the internet or named network resources. If the DNS server settings are incorrect or the DNS server is down, the technician will not be able to access these resources even if they have a valid IP address and can ping the default gateway1.

A Windows workstation that was recently updated with approved system patches shut down instead of restarting. Upon reboot, the technician notices an alert stating the workstation has malware in the root OS folder. The technician promptly performs a System Restore and reboots the workstation, but the malware is still detected. Which of the following BEST describes why the system still has malware?

- A. A system patch disabled the antivirus protection and host firewall.
- B. The system updates did not include the latest anti-malware definitions.
- C. The system restore process was compromised by the malware.
- D. The malware was installed before the system restore point was created.

Answer: D

# Explanation:

The best explanation for why the system still has malware after performing a System Restore is that the malware was installed before the system restore point was created. A system restore point is a snapshot of the system settings and configuration at a certain point in time. A System Restore is a feature that allows users to restore their system to a previous state in case of problems or errors. However, a System Restore does not affect personal files or folders, and it may not remove malware that was already present on the system before the restore point was created. A system patch disabling the antivirus protection and host firewall may increase the risk of malware infection, but it does not explain why the malware persists after a System Restore. The system updates not including the latest anti-malware definitions may reduce the effectiveness of malware detection and removal, but it does not explain why the malware persists after a System Restore. The system restore process being compromised by the malware may prevent a successful System Restore, but it does not explain why the malware persists after a System Restore.

The installation of home edition software on computers at a local office most likely violates the EULA. EULA stands for End User License Agreement and is a legal contract that specifies the terms and conditions for using a software product or service. EULA typically covers topics such as license scope, duration and limitations, rights and obligations of the parties, warranties and disclaimers, liability and indemnity clauses, and termination procedures. EULA may also restrict the use of home edition software to personal or non-commercial purposes only, and prohibit the use of home edition software in business or professional settings. Violating EULA may result in legal actions or penalties from the software vendor or developer.

PII stands for Personally Identifiable Information and is any information that can be used to identify or locate an individual, such as name, address, phone number, email address, social security number or credit card number. PII is not related to software installation or licensing but to data protection and privacy.

DRM stands for Digital Rights Management and is a technology that controls or restricts the access and use of digital content, such as music, movies, books or games. DRM is not related to software installation or licensing but to content distribution and piracy prevention.

Open-source agreement is a type of license that allows users to access, modify and distribute the source code of a software product or service freely and openly. Open-source agreement does not restrict the use of software to home edition only but encourages collaboration and innovation among developers and users.

- A. Synchronize the browser data.
- B. Enable private browsing mode.
- C. Mark the site as trusted.
- D. Clear the cached file.

A technician suspects a rootkit has been installed and needs to be removed. Which of the following would BEST resolve the issue?

- A. Application updates
- B. Anti-malware software
- C. OS reinstallation
- D. File restore

Answer: C

Explanation: If a rootkit has caused a deep infection, then the only way to remove the rootkit is to reinstall the operating system. This is because rootkits are designed to be difficult to detect and remove, and they can hide in the operating system’s kernel, making it difficult to remove them without reinstalling the operating system source.

A help desk technician determines a motherboard has failed. Which of the following is the most logical next step in the remediation process?

- A. Escalating the issue to Tier 2
- B. Verifying warranty status with the vendor
- C. Replacing the motherboard
- D. Purchasing another PC

Answer: B

Explanation: Verifying warranty status with the vendor is the most logical next step in the remediation process after determining that a motherboard has failed. A warranty is a guarantee from the vendor that covers the repair or replacement of defective or faulty products within a specified period of time. Verifying warranty status with the vendor can help the technician determine if the motherboard is eligible for warranty service and what steps to take to obtain it. Escalating the issue to Tier 2, replacing the motherboard, and purchasing another PC are not the most logical next steps in the remediation process.

# 152. Which of the following filesystems replaced FAT as the preferred filesystem for Microsoft Windows OS?

- A. APFS
- B. FAT32
- C. NTFS
- D. ext4

Answer: C

# Explanation:

NTFS stands for New Technology File System and it is the preferred filesystem for Microsoft Windows OS since Windows NT 3.1 in 1993. NTFS replaced FAT (File Allocation Table) as the default filesystem for Windows because it offers many advantages over FAT, such as:

- Support for larger volumes and files (up to 16 exabytes)
- Support for file compression, encryption, and permissions
- Support for journaling, which records changes to the filesystem and helps recover from errors
- Support for hard links, symbolic links, and mount points
- Support for long filenames and Unicode characters

FAT32 is an improved version of FAT that supports larger volumes and files (up to 32 GB and 4 GB respectively) and is compatible with older versions of Windows and other operating systems. However, FAT32 still has many limitations and drawbacks compared to NTFS, such as:

- No support for file compression, encryption, and permissions
- No support for journaling, which makes it vulnerable to corruption and data loss
- No support for hard links, symbolic links, and mount points
- No support for long filenames and Unicode characters

APFS (Apple File System) is the default filesystem for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS since 2017. APFS replaced HFS+ (Hierarchical File System Plus) as the preferred filesystem for Apple devices because it offers many advantages over HFS+, such as:

- Support for larger volumes and files (up to 8 zettabytes)
- Support for file cloning, snapshots, and encryption
- Support for space sharing, which allows multiple volumes to share the same storage pool
- Support for fast directory sizing, which improves performance and efficiency

ext4 (Fourth Extended)

# Filesystem

ext4 is the default filesystem for most Linux distributions since 2008. ext4 replaced ext3 as the preferred filesystem for Linux because it offers many advantages over ext3, such as:

- Support for larger volumes and files (up to 1 exabyte and 16 terabytes respectively)
- Support for extents, which reduce fragmentation and improve performance
- Support for journal checksumming, which improves reliability and reduces recovery time
- Support for delayed allocation, which improves efficiency and reduces metadata overhead

# Question

A technician downloads a validated security tool and notes the vendor hash of a58e87a2. When the download is complete, the technician again validates the hash, but the value returns as 2a876a7d3. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause of the issue?

- A. Private-browsing mode
- B. Invalid certificate
- C. Modified file
- D. Browser cache

Answer: C

# Explanation:

The most likely cause of the issue of having different hash values for a downloaded security tool is a modified file. A hash value is a unique and fixed-length string that is generated from an algorithm that processes data or files. A hash value can be used to verify the integrity and authenticity of data or files by comparing it with a known or expected value. If the hash values do not match, it means that the data or file has been altered or corrupted in some way. A modified file may result from intentional or unintentional changes, such as editing, encryption, compression or malware infection.

Private-browsing mode is a feature that allows users to browse the web without storing any browsing history, cookies or cache on their browser. Private-browsing mode does not affect the hash value of a downloaded file but only how the browser handles user data. Invalid certificate is an error that occurs when a website or a server does not have a valid or trusted digital certificate that proves its identity and secures.

While trying to repair a Windows 10 OS, a technician receives a prompt asking for a key. The technician tries the administrator password, but it is rejected. Which of the following does the technician need in order to continue the OS repair?

- A. SSL key
- B. Preshared key
- C. WPA2 key
- D. Recovery key

Answer: D

Explanation: A recovery key is a code that can be used to unlock a BitLocker-encrypted drive when the normal authentication methods (such as password or PIN) are not available or have been forgotten. BitLocker is a feature of Windows that encrypts the entire drive to protect data from unauthorized access. If a technician is trying to repair a Windows 10 OS that has BitLocker enabled, they will need the recovery key to access the drive and continue the OS repair. SSL key, preshared key, and WPA2 key are not keys that are related to BitLocker or OS repair.

WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) is a security protocol for wireless networks that does not use SMS or third-party applications. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm that does not use SMS or third-party applications. RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is a network protocol that provides centralized authentication and authorization for remote access clients, but does not use SMS or third-party applications.

# 156. Which of the following is also known as something you know, something you have, and something you are?

- A. ACL
- B. MFA
- C. SMS
- D. NFC

Answer: B

Explanation: MFA stands for Multi-Factor Authentication, which is a method of verifying a user’s identity using two or more different factors of authentication. The three factors of authentication are something you know, something you have, and something you are. These factors correspond to different types of information or evidence that only the legitimate user should possess or provide. For example:

- ✑ Something you know: a password, a PIN, a security question, etc.
- ✑ Something you have: a smart card, a token, a mobile device, etc.
- ✑ Something you are: a fingerprint, a face, an iris, etc.

MFA provides a higher level of security than single-factor authentication, which only uses one factor, such as a password. MFA reduces the risk of unauthorized access, identity theft, and data breaches, as an attacker would need to compromise more than one factor to impersonate a user. MFA is commonly used for online banking, email accounts, cloud services, and other sensitive applications.

The No.1 IT Certification Dumps

---

# Certify For Sure with IT Exam Dumps

C. Back up the files and do a system restore.

D. Undo the jailbreak and enable an antivirus.

Answer: B

# Explanation:

The best course of action for the technician is to restore the defaults and reimage the corporate OS on the device. This will remove the jailbreak and any unauthorized or malicious apps that may have been installed on the device, as well as restore the security features and policies that the company has set for its devices. This will also ensure that the device can receive the latest updates and patches from the manufacturer and the company, and prevent any data leakage or compromise from the device.

Jailbreaking is a process of bypassing the built-in security features of a device to install software other than what the manufacturer has made available for that device1. Jailbreaking allows the device owner to gain full access to the root of the operating system and access all the features1. However, jailbreaking also exposes the device to various risks, such as:

- The loss of warranty from the device manufacturers2.
- Inability to update software until a jailbroken version becomes available2.
- Increased security vulnerabilities3.
- Decreased battery life2.
- Increased volatility of the device2.

Some of the signs of a jailbroken device are:

- A high number of ads, which may indicate the presence of adware or spyware on the device3.
- Receiving data-usage limit notifications, which may indicate the device is sending or receiving data in the background without the user’s knowledge or consent3.
- Experiencing slow response, which may indicate the device is running unauthorized or malicious apps that consume resources or interfere with the normal functioning of the device3.
- Finding apps or icons that the user did not install or recognize, such as Cydia, which is a storefront for jailbroken iOS devices1.

The other options are not sufficient or appropriate for dealing with a jailbroken device. Running an antivirus and enabling encryption may not detect or remove all the threats or vulnerabilities that the jailbreak has introduced, and may not restore the device to its original state or functionality. Backing up the files and doing a system restore may not erase the jailbreak or the unauthorized apps, and may also backup the infected or compromised files. Undoing the jailbreak and enabling an antivirus may not be possible or

effective, as the jailbreak may prevent the device from updating or installing security software, and may also leave traces of the jailbreak or the unauthorized apps on the device.

A desktop technician has received reports that a user's PC is slow to load programs and saved files. The technician investigates and discovers an older HDD with adequate free space. Which of the following should the technician use to alleviate the issue first?

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>A.</td>
<td>Disk Management</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B.</td>
<td>Disk Defragment</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C.</td>
<td>Disk Cleanup</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D.</td>
<td>Device Manager</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

Answer: B

Explanation: Disk Defragment is a tool that can be used to improve the performance of a hard disk drive (HDD). HDDs store data in sectors and clusters on spinning platters. Over time, as data is written, deleted, and moved, the data may become fragmented, meaning that it is spread across different locations on the disk. This causes the HDD to take longer to access and load data, resulting in slower performance. Disk Defragment consolidates the fragmented data and rearranges it in a contiguous manner, which reduces the seek time and increases the speed of the HDD. Disk Management, Disk Cleanup, and Device Manager are not tools that can alleviate the issue of slow HDD performance.

A company is looking for a solution that provides a backup for all data on the system while providing the lowest impact to the network. Which of the following backup types will the company MOST likely select?

- A. Off-site
- B. Synthetic
- C. Full
- D. Differential

Answer: B

Explanation: A synthetic backup is a backup type that provides a backup for all data on the system while providing the lowest impact to the network. It combines a full backup with one or more incremental backups to create a single backup set, without requiring access to the original data source. Off-site is a backup location, not a backup type. Full and differential are backup types, but they have a higher impact on the network than synthetic.

# 165. A computer on a corporate network has a malware infection. Which of the following would be the BEST method for returning the computer to service?

- A. Scanning the system with a Linux live disc, flashing the BIOS, and then returning the computer to service
- B. Flashing the BIOS, reformatting the drive, and then reinstalling the OS
- C. Degaussing the hard drive, flashing the BIOS, and then reinstalling the OS
- D. Reinstalling the OS, flashing the BIOS, and then scanning with on-premises antivirus

Answer: B

# Explanation:

Flashing the BIOS, reformatting the drive, and then reinstalling the OS is the best method for returning a computer with a malware infection to service. Flashing the BIOS updates the firmware of the motherboard and can remove any malware that may have infected it. Reformatting the drive erases all data on it and can remove any malware that may have infected it. Reinstalling the OS restores the system files and settings to their original state and can remove any malware that may have modified them. Scanning the system with a Linux live disc may not detect or remove all malware infections. Degaussing the hard drive is an extreme method of destroying data that may damage the drive beyond repair. Reinstalling the OS before flashing the BIOS or scanning with antivirus may not remove malware infections that persist in the BIOS or.

An office is experiencing constant connection attempts to the corporate Wi-Fi. Which of the following should be disabled to mitigate connection attempts?

- A. SSID
- B. DHCP
- C. Firewall
- D. SSD

Answer: A

Explanation: The SSID (Service Set Identifier) is the name of a wireless network that is broadcasted by the router or the Wi-Fi base station. The SSID helps nearby devices to identify and connect to the available networks. However, broadcasting the SSID also exposes the network to potential connection attempts from unauthorized or malicious users. Therefore, disabling the SSID can mitigate connection attempts by making the network invisible or hidden to the devices that are not already connected to it. To connect to a hidden network, the user would need to know the exact SSID and enter it manually. The other options are not related to mitigating connection attempts to the corporate Wi-Fi. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a protocol that assigns IP addresses to the devices on a network. Firewall is a software or hardware device that filters the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules. SSD (Solid State Drive) is a type of storage device that uses flash memory to store data. Disabling any of these options would not prevent connection attempts to the Wi-Fi network, and may cause other problems or issues for the network functionality and performance.

and other systems. Ransomware can encrypt files, steal data, and spread to other devices on the network if the infected machine remains online. Turning off the machine will stop the ransomware process and isolate the machine from the network12. The other options are either ineffective or risky. Running a full antivirus scan may not detect or remove the ransomware, especially if it is a new or unknown variant. Removing the LAN card may disconnect the machine from the network, but it will not stop the ransomware from encrypting or deleting files on the local drive. Installing a different endpoint solution may not be possible or helpful if the ransomware has already compromised the system or blocked the installation.

- A. gpupdate
- B. net use
- C. hostname
- D. dir

Answer: B

Explanation: Net use is a command-line tool that can be used to map a drive in Windows. Mapping a drive means assigning a drive letter to a network location or a local folder, which allows the user to access it more easily and quickly. Net use can also be used to disconnect a mapped drive, display information about mapped drives, or connect to shared resources on another computer.

# B. Battery

# C. Accelerometer

# D. Digitizer

Answer: C

# Explanation:

The piece of hardware that the technician should replace to resolve the issue of the screen failing to rotate on a mobile device that was dropped is the accelerometer. The accelerometer is a sensor that detects the orientation and movement of the mobile device by measuring the acceleration forces acting on it. The accelerometer allows the screen to rotate automatically according to the position and angle of the device. If the accelerometer is damaged or malfunctioning, the screen may not rotate properly or at all, even if the settings are correctly applied. LCD stands for Liquid Crystal Display and is a type of display that uses liquid crystals and backlight to produce images on the screen. LCD is not related to the screen rotation feature but to the quality and brightness of the display.

A customer called the help desk to report that a machine that was recently updated is no longer working. The support technician checks the latest logs to see what updates were deployed, but nothing was deployed in more than three weeks. Which of the following should the support technician do to BEST resolve the situation?

- A. Offer to wipe and reset the device for the customer.
- B. Advise that the help desk will investigate and follow up at a later date.
- C. Put the customer on hold and escalate the call to a manager.
- D. Use open-ended questions to further diagnose the issue.

Answer: D

# Explanation:

Open-ended questions are questions that require more than a yes or no answer and encourage the customer to provide more details and information. Using open-ended questions can help the support technician to understand the problem better, identify the root cause, and find a suitable solution. Some examples of open-ended questions are:

- What exactly is not working on your machine?
- When did you notice the problem?
- How often does the problem occur?
- What were you doing when the problem happened?
- What have you tried to fix the problem?

Offering to wipe and reset the device for the customer is not a good option, as it may result in data loss and inconvenience for the customer. It should be used as a last resort only if other troubleshooting steps fail.

Advising that the help desk will investigate and follow up at a later date is not a good option, as it may leave the customer unsatisfied and frustrated. It should be used only if the problem requires further research or escalation and cannot be resolved on the first call.

Which of the following options in the Windows settings should the technician use?

- A. Ease of Access
- B. Privacy
- C. Personalization
- D. Update and Security

Answer: C

Explanation: The technician should use the Personalization option in the Windows settings to enable a Screensaver lock.

A technician is trying to remove malware from a laptop from the network. Which of the following should the technician do to prevent the operating system from automatically returning to an infected state?

- A. Enable System Restore.
- B. Disable System Restore.
- C. Enable antivirus.
- D. Disable antivirus.
- E. Educate the user.

Answer: B

Explanation: System Restore is a feature that allows the user to revert the system to a previous state. However, this can also restore the malware that was removed by the technician. Disabling System Restore can prevent the operating system from automatically returning to an infected state. Enabling antivirus, educating the user, and enabling System Restore are good preventive measures, but they do not address the question. Disabling antivirus can make the system more vulnerable to malware attacks.

# 2. Question

A technician installed Windows 10 on a workstation. The workstation only has 3.5GB of usable RAM, even though the technician installed 8GB. Which of the following is the MOST likely reason this system is not utilizing all the available RAM?

- A. The system is missing updates.
- B. The system is utilizing a 32-bit OS.
- C. The system's memory is failing.
- D. The system requires BIOS updates.

Answer: B

Explanation: The most likely reason that the system is not utilizing all the available RAM is that it is running a 32-bit OS. A 32-bit OS can only address up to 4GB of RAM, and some of that is reserved for hardware and system use. Therefore, even if the technician installed 8GB of RAM, the system can only use around 3.5GB of usable RAM. To use the full 8GB of RAM, the technician would need to install a 64-bit OS, which can address much more memory. The system missing updates, the system’s memory failing, or the system requiring BIOS updates are not likely to cause this issue.

A technician is preparing to remediate a Trojan virus that was found on a workstation. Which of the following steps should the technician complete BEFORE removing the virus?

- A. Disable System Restore.
- B. Schedule a malware scan.
- C. Educate the end user.
- D. Run Windows Update.

Answer: A

Explanation: Before removing a Trojan virus from a workstation, a technician should disable System Restore. System Restore is a feature that allows users to restore their system to a previous state in case of problems or errors. However, System Restore can also restore infected files or registry entries that were removed by antivirus software or manual actions. By disabling System Restore, a technician can ensure that the Trojan virus is completely removed and does not reappear after a system restore operation.

Scheduling a malware scan may help detect and remove some malware but may not be effective against all types of Trojan viruses. Educating the end user may help prevent future infections but does not address the current issue of removing the Trojan virus. Running Windows Update may help patch some security vulnerabilities but does not guarantee that the Trojan virus will be removed.

- A. SAN
- B. LAN
- C. GPU
- D. PAN

Answer: B

Explanation: LAN is the most likely option to be impacted in this situation. LAN stands for Local Area Network, and it is a network that connects devices within a limited area, such as a building or a campus. Installing high-definition IP videoconferencing equipment in all classrooms would require a high bandwidth and reliable LAN infrastructure to support the video and audio transmission.

A technician is in the process of installing a new hard drive on a server but is called away to another task. The drive has been unpackaged and left on a desk. Which of the following should the technician perform before leaving?

- A. Ask coworkers to make sure no one touches the hard drive.
- B. Leave the hard drive on the table; it will be okay while the other task is completed.
- C. Place the hard drive in an antistatic bag and secure the area containing the hard drive.
- D. Connect an electrostatic discharge strap to the drive.

Answer: C

Explanation: The technician should place the hard drive in an antistatic bag and secure the area containing the hard drive before leaving. This will protect the hard drive from electrostatic discharge (ESD), dust, moisture, and physical damage. Asking coworkers to make sure no one touches the hard drive is not a reliable or secure way to prevent damage. Leaving the hard drive on the table exposes it to ESD and other environmental hazards. Connecting an electrostatic discharge strap to the drive is not enough to protect it from dust, moisture, and physical damage.

A technician is troubleshooting a Windows 10 PC that is unable to start the GUI. A new SSD and a new copy of Windows were recently installed on the PC. Which of the following is the most appropriate command to use to fix the issue?

- A. msconfig
- B. chkdsk
- C. sfc
- D. diskpart
- E. mstsc

Answer: C

Explanation: The sfc command is a tool for scanning and repairing system files that are corrupted or missing on Windows operating systems. System files are essential files that are required for the proper functioning of the operating system.

functioning of the operating system, such as the GUI, drivers, services, and applications. If system files are damaged or deleted, the operating system may fail to start or run properly, causing errors, crashes, or blue screens.

The sfc command can be used to fix the issue of the PC that is unable to start the GUI, assuming that the problem is caused by corrupted or missing system files. The sfc command can be run from the command prompt, which can be accessed by booting the PC from the installation media, choosing the repair option, and selecting the command prompt option3. The sfc command can be used with different switches, such as /scannow, /verifyonly, /scanfile, or /offbootdir, depending on the situation and the desired action4. The most common switch is /scannow, which scans all the system files and repairs any problems that are found5. The syntax of the sfc command with the /scannow switch is: sfc /scannow

The sfc command will then scan and repair the system files, and display the results on the screen. If the sfc command is able to fix the system files, the PC should be able to start the GUI normally after rebooting. If the sfc command is unable to fix the system files, the PC may need further troubleshooting or a clean installation of Windows.

A BSOD appears on a user's workstation monitor. The user immediately presses the power button to shut down the PC, hoping to repair the issue. The user then restarts the PC, and the BSOD reappears, so the user contacts the help desk. Which of the following should the technician use to determine the cause?

- A. Stop code
- B. Event Mewer
- C. Services
- D. System Configuration

Answer: A

Explanation: When a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) appears on a Windows workstation, it indicates that there is a serious problem with the operating system. The stop code displayed on the BSOD can provide valuable information to help determine the cause of the issue. The stop code is a specific error code that is associated with the BSOD, and it can help identify the root cause of the problem.

In this scenario, the user has encountered a BSOD and has restarted the PC, only to see the BSOD reappear. This suggests that the problem is persistent and requires further investigation. By analyzing the stop code displayed on the BSOD, a technician can begin to identify the underlying issue and take appropriate actions to resolve it.

A Windows user recently replaced a computer. The user can access the public internet on the computer; however, an internal site at https://companyintranet.com:8888 is no longer loading. Which of the following should a technician adjust to resolve the issue?

- A. Default gateway settings
- B. DHCP settings
- C. IP address settings
- D. Firewall settings
- E. Antivirus settings

Answer: D

# Explanation:

The technician should adjust the firewall settings to resolve the issue of not being able to access an internal site at https://companyintranet.com:8888. The firewall settings control how the firewall filters and allows network traffic based on rules and policies. The firewall settings may be blocking or preventing the access to the internal site by mistake or by default, especially if the site uses a non-standard port number such as 8888. The technician should check and modify the firewall settings to allow the access to the internal site or its port number.

Default gateway settings determine how a computer connects to other networks or the internet. Default gateway settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access the public internet. DHCP settings determine how a computer obtains its IP address and other network configuration parameters automatically from a DHCP server. DHCP settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access other network resources. IP address settings determine how a computer identifies itself and communicates with other devices on a network. IP address settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access other network resources. Antivirus settings control how the antivirus software scans and protects the computer from malware and threats. Antivirus settings are less likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site than firewall settings, unless the antivirus software has its own firewall feature that may interfere with the network traffic.

A hotel's Wi-Fi was used to steal information on a corporate laptop. A technician notes the following security log:

SRC: 192.168.1.1/secrets.zip Protocol SMB >> DST: 192.168.1.50/capture The technician analyses the following Windows firewall information:

Which of the following protocols most likely allowed the data theft to occur?

- A. 1
- B. 53
- C. 110
- D. 445

Answer: D

# Explanation:

The protocol that most likely allowed the data theft to occur is SMB over TCP port 445. SMB is a network file sharing protocol that enables access to files, printers, and other resources on a network. Port 445 is used by SMB to communicate directly over TCP without the need for NetBIOS, which is an older and less secure protocol. The security log shows that the source IP address 192.168.1.1 sent a file named secrets.zip using SMB protocol to the destination IP address 192.168.1.50, which captured the file. The Windows firewall information shows that port 445 is enabled for inbound and outbound traffic, which means that it is not blocked by the firewall. Therefore, port 445 is the most likely port that was exploited by the attacker to steal the data from the corporate laptop.

A department has the following technical requirements for a new application:

The company plans to upgrade from a 32-bit Windows OS to a 64-bit OS. Which of the following will the company be able to fully take advantage of after the upgrade?

- A. CPU
- B. Hard drive
- C. RAM
- D. Touch screen

Answer: C

Explanation: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/difference-32-bit-64-bit-windows/

After upgrading from a 32-bit Windows OS to a 64-bit OS, the company will be able to fully take advantage of the RAM of the computer. This is because a 64-bit operating system is able to use larger amounts of RAM compared to a 32-bit operating system, which may benefit the system’s overall performance if it has more than 4GB of RAM installed.

# Questions and Answers

# 227. Which of the following backup methods only backs up files that have changed since the last backup?

A. Full

B. Mirror

C. Incremental

D. Differential

Answer: C

Explanation: Incremental backup is a backup method that only backs up the files that have changed since the last backup, whether it was a full or an incremental backup. Incremental backup can save storage space and bandwidth, as it does not copy the same files over and over again. Incremental backup can also retain more versions of backups, as it only stores the changes made to the files. However, incremental backup can have longer restore times, as it requires restoring the last full backup and all the subsequent incremental backups in order to recover the data. The law firm is not concerned about restore times but asks the technician to retain more versions when possible, so incremental backup would be a suitable choice for them.

Certify For Sure with IT Exam Dumps

# D. Incremental backups

Answer: B

Explanation: Regionally diverse backups are backups that are stored in different geographic locations, preferably far away from the primary site1. This way, if a disaster such as a hurricane or a power outage affects one location, the backups in another location will still be available and accessible2. Regionally diverse backups can help ensure business continuity and data recovery in case of a disaster3. The other options are not the best backup solutions for a site in an area that has frequent hurricanes and an unstable power grid. High availability is a feature that allows a system to remain operational and accessible even if one or more components fail, but it does not protect against data loss or corruption4. On-site backups are backups that are stored in the same location as the primary site, which means they are vulnerable to the same disasters that can affect the primary site. Incremental backups are backups that only store the changes made since the last backup, which means they require less storage space and bandwidth, but they also depend on previous backups to restore data and may not be sufficient for disaster recovery.

A user reports that the pages flash on the screen two or three times before finally staying open when attempting to access banking web pages. Which of the following troubleshooting steps should the technician perform NEXT to resolve the issue?

- A. Examine the antivirus logs.
- B. Verify the address bar URL.
- C. Test the internet connection speed.
- D. Check the web service status.

Answer: B

Explanation: The next troubleshooting step that the technician should perform to resolve the issue of pages flashing on the screen before staying open when accessing banking web pages is to verify the address bar URL. The address bar URL is the web address that appears in the browser’s address bar and indicates the location of the web page being accessed. Verifying the address bar URL can help determine if the user is accessing a legitimate or malicious website, as some phishing websites may try to impersonate banking websites by using similar-looking URLs or domains.

An employee has repeatedly contacted a technician about malware infecting a work computer. The technician has removed the malware several times, but the user's PC keeps getting infected. Which of the following should the technician do to reduce the risk of future infections?

- A. Configure the firewall.
- B. Restore the system from backups.
- C. Educate the end user
- D. Update the antivirus program.

Answer: C

Explanation: Malware is software that infects computer systems to damage, disable or exploit the computer or network for various malicious purposes5. Malware is typically distributed via email attachments, fake internet ads, infected applications or websites, and often relies on user interaction to execute6. Therefore, one of the most effective ways to prevent malware infections is to educate the end user about the common signs and sources of malware, and how to avoid them7. Configuring the firewall, restoring the system from backups, and updating the antivirus program are also important security measures, but they do not address the root cause of the user’s repeated infections, which is likely due to a lack of awareness or caution.

A technician connects an additional monitor to a PC using a USB port. The original HDMI monitor is mounted to the left of the new monitor. When moving the mouse to the right from the original monitor to the new monitor, the mouse stops at the end of the screen on the original monitor. Which of the following will allow the mouse to correctly move to the new monitor?

- A. Rearranging the monitor's position in display settings
- B. Swapping the cables for the monitors
- C. Using the Ctrl+AIt+> to correct the display orientation
- D. Updating the display drivers for the video card

Answer: B

Explanation: The correct answer is B. Swapping the cables for the monitors. When the second monitor is connected with the HDMI port, it is necessary to swap the cables for the monitors so that the mouse can move from the original monitor to the new monitor. This is because the HDMI port is designed to only support one monitor, and the mouse will not be able to move from one to the other without the cables being swapped.

According to CompTIA A+ Core 2 documents, "When connecting multiple displays to a system, the cables used to connect the displays must be swapped between the displays. For example, if a monitor is connected to a system using a VGA cable, the VGA cable must be moved to the next display to allow the mouse to move between the two displays."

unsupervised. Which of the following describes how the technician should handle personal communication while on site?

1. A. Respond to calls and text messages while on site but not when working directly with personnel.
2. B. Respond to calls and text messages only from family.
3. C. Respond to calls and text messages only when an emergency situation requires a response.
4. D. Respond to calls and text messages discreetly while on site.

Answer: C

# Explanation:

A technician should handle personal communication while on site in a professional and respectful manner. According to the CompTIA A+ Core 2 (220-1102) exam objectives, one of the best practices for communication skills is to “avoid distractions and interruptions” when working with customers1. This means that the technician should not respond to calls and text messages that are not related to the work or the customer, unless there is an emergency situation that requires a response. Responding to personal communication while on site can be seen as rude, unprofessional, and disrespectful to the customer and their time. It can also affect the quality and efficiency of the technician’s work and cause errors or delays. Therefore, the technician should only respond to calls and text messages when an emergency situation requires a response, and inform the customer about the situation and apologize for the interruption.

The other options are not appropriate for handling personal communication while on site. Responding to calls and text messages while on site but not when working directly with personnel (A) is still distracting and unprofessional, as it can interfere with the technician’s focus and productivity. Responding to calls and text messages only from family (B) is not a valid criterion, as the technician may receive calls and text messages from other sources that are not related to the work or the customer. Responding to calls and text messages discreetly while on site (D) is not a good practice, as it can still be noticed by the customer or other personnel and create a negative impression.

A user lost a company tablet that was used for customer intake at a doctor's office. Which of the following actions would BEST protect against unauthorized access of the data?

- A. Changing the office's Wi-Fi SSID and password
- B. Performing a remote wipe on the device
- C. Changing the user's password
- D. Enabling remote drive encryption

Answer: B

Explanation: The best action to protect against unauthorized access of the data on the lost company tablet is to perform a remote wipe on the device. A remote wipe is a feature that allows an administrator or a user to erase all the data and settings on a device remotely, usually through a web portal or an email command. A remote wipe can help prevent the data from being accessed or compromised by anyone who finds or steals the device. Changing the office’s Wi-Fi SSID and password may prevent the device from connecting to the office network but may not prevent the data from being accessed locally or through other networks. Changing the user’s password may prevent the device from logging in to the user’s account but may not prevent the data from being accessed by other means or accounts. Enabling remote drive encryption may protect the data from being read by unauthorized parties but may not be possible if the device is already lost or turned off.

A user is unable to access a remote server from a corporate desktop computer using the appropriate terminal emulation program. The user contacts the help desk to report the issue. Which of the following clarifying questions would be most effective for the help desk technician to ask the user in order to understand the issue?

- A. What is the error message?
- B. Does the program work on another computer?
- C. Did the program ever work?
- D. Is anyone else having this issue?

Answer: A

Explanation: The most effective clarifying question for the help desk technician to ask the user in order to understand the issue is A. What is the error message? This question will help the technician to identify the possible cause and solution of the problem, as the error message will provide specific information about the nature and location of the error, such as the server name, the port number, the protocol, the authentication method, or the network status. The error message will also help the technician to troubleshoot the issue by following the suggested steps or searching for the error code online.

This question is more effective than the other choices because:

- ✑ B. Does the program work on another computer? is not a very helpful question, as it will not reveal the source of the error or how to fix it. The program may work on another computer for various reasons, such as different network settings, firewall rules, permissions, or software versions. However, this question will not tell the technician what is wrong with the user’s computer or the remote server, or what needs to be changed or updated to make the program work.
- ✑ C. Did the program ever work? is not a very relevant question, as it will not address the current issue or how to resolve it. The program may have worked in the past, but it may have stopped working due to changes in the network configuration, the server status, the software updates, or the user credentials. However, this question will not tell the technician what has changed or how to restore the program.

A user is unable to access a website, which is widely used across the organization, and receives the following error message:

The security certificate presented by this website has expired or is not yet valid.

The technician confirms the website works when accessing it from another computer but not from the user's computer. Which of the following should the technician perform NEXT to troubleshoot the issue?

- A. Reboot the computer.
- B. Reinstall the OS.
- C. Configure a static 12
- D. Check the computer's date and time.

Answer: D

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the security certificate presented by the website has either expired or is not yet valid. This can happen if the computer's clock has the wrong date or time, as SSL/TLS certificates have a specific validity period. If the clock is off by too much, it may cause the certificate to fail to validate. Therefore, the technician should check the computer's date and time and ensure that they are correct.

# 261. A user is setting up backups on a workstation. The user wants to ensure that the restore process is as simple as possible. Which of the following backup types should the user select?

A. Full

B. Incremental

C. Differential

D. Synthetic

Answer: A

Explanation:

Full backup is the best option to ensure that the restore process is as simple as possible. A full backup is a backup type that copies all the data from the source to the destination, regardless of whether the data has changed or not. A full backup provides the most complete and consistent backup of the data, and it allows the user to restore the data from a single backup set without relying on any previous or subsequent backups. Incremental, differential, and synthetic backups are not as simple as full backups for restoring data. An incremental backup is a backup type that copies only the data that has changed since the last backup, whether it was full or incremental. An incremental backup requires less time and space than a full backup, but it also requires multiple backup sets to restore the data completely. A differential backup is a backup type that copies only the data that has changed since the last full backup. A differential backup requires more time and space than an incremental backup, but it also requires fewer backup sets to restore the data than an incremental backup. A synthetic backup is a backup type that combines a full backup with one or more incremental or differential backups to create a consolidated backup set. A synthetic backup requires less time and bandwidth than a full backup, but it also requires more processing power and storage space than an incremental or differential backup.

- A. Reinstall the application on the smartphone.
- B. Update the smartphone's OS.
- C. Reset the smartphone to factory settings.
- D. Reboot the smartphone.

Answer: D

Explanation: Rebooting the smartphone is the first and simplest step to resolve the issue of frequent crashes and unresponsiveness. Rebooting clears the memory, closes the background apps, and refreshes the system. It can also fix minor glitches and bugs that may cause the calendar app or the smartphone to malfunction. The other options are either too drastic or unnecessary. Reinstalling the application may not solve the problem if the issue is with the smartphone itself. Updating the smartphone’s OS may not be possible or helpful if the device is unresponsive or incompatible. Resetting the smartphone to factory settings will erase all the data and settings on the device, which should be the last resort.

A workstation is displaying a message indicating that a user must exchange cryptocurrency for a decryption key. Which of the following is the best way for a technician to return the device to service safely?

- A. Run an AV scan.
- B. Reinstall the operating system
- C. Install a software firewall.
- D. Perform a system restore.
- E. Comply with the on-screen instructions.

Answer: B

Explanation: The best way for a technician to return the device to service safely is to reinstall the operating system. This is because the device is infected by ransomware, which is a form of malware that encrypts files and demands payment for decryption. Reinstalling the operating system will erase the ransomware and restore the device to its original state. However, this will also delete any data that was not backed up before the infection. Therefore, it is important to have regular backups of critical data and protect them from ransomware attacks1.

The other options are not effective or safe for ransomware recovery. Running an AV scan may not detect or remove the ransomware, especially if it is a new or unknown variant. Installing a software firewall may prevent future attacks, but it will not help with the current infection. Performing a system restore may not work if the ransomware has corrupted or deleted the restore points. Complying with the on-screen instructions is not advisable, as it will encourage the attackers and there is no guarantee that they will provide the decryption key after receiving the payment.

To prevent and recover from ransomware attacks, it is recommended to follow some best practices, such as234:

- Use strong passwords and multifactor authentication for all accounts and devices.
- Keep all software and firmware updated with the latest security patches.
- Avoid opening suspicious or unsolicited emails and attachments.

A user opened a ticket regarding a corporate-managed mobile device. The assigned technician notices the OS is several versions out of date. The user is unaware the OS version is not current because auto-update is turned on. Which of the following is MOST likely the cause of the issue?

- A. The device does not have enough free space to download the OS updates.
- B. The device needs domain administrator confirmation to update to a major release.
- C. The device is not compatible with the newest version of the OS.
- D. The device is restricted from updating due to a corporate security policy.

Answer: D

Explanation: A corporate security policy can restrict a corporate-managed mobile device from updating its OS automatically, even if the auto-update feature is turned on. This can be done to prevent compatibility issues, security risks or performance problems caused by untested or unwanted updates. The device administrator can control when and how the updates are applied to the device. The device not having enough free space, needing domain administrator confirmation or being incompatible with the newest version of the OS are not likely causes of the issue, since the user would receive an error message or a notification in those cases.

A technician is upgrading the backup system for documents at a high-volume law firm. The current backup system can retain no more than three versions of full backups before failing. The law firm is not concerned about restore times but asks the technician to retain more versions when possible. Which of the following backup methods should the technician MOST likely implement?

- A. Full
- B. Mirror
- C. Incremental
- D. Differential

Answer: C

Explanation: The law firm wants to retain more versions of the backups when possible, so the best backup method for the technician to implement in this scenario would be Incremental backup. Incremental backups only save the changes made since the last backup, which allows for more frequent backups and minimizes the amount of storage required. This would allow the law firm to retain more than three versions of backups without risking backup failure.

To retain more versions of backups, the technician should implement an Incremental backup method. An incremental backup method only backs up the data that has changed since the last backup, so it requires less storage space than a full backup.

A systems administrator received a request to limit the amount of cellular data a user's Windows 10 tablet can utilize when traveling. Which of the following can the administrator do to best solve the user's issue?

- A. Turn on airplane mode.
- B. Set the connection to be metered.
- C. Configure the device to use a static IP address.
- D. Enable the Windows Defender Firewall.

Answer: B

# Explanation:

Setting the connection to be metered is the best solution for limiting the amount of cellular data a user’s Windows 10 tablet can utilize when traveling. A metered connection is a network connection that has a data limit or charges fees based on the amount of data used. Windows 10 allows users to set any network connection as metered, which reduces the amount of data that Windows and some apps use in the background. For example, setting a connection as metered will prevent Windows from downloading updates automatically, stop some apps from syncing data online, and disable some live tiles on the Start menu. Setting a connection as metered can help users save cellular data and avoid extra charges when traveling.

Turning on airplane mode, configuring the device to use a static IP address, and enabling the Windows Defender Firewall are not effective solutions for limiting the amount of cellular data a user’s Windows 10 tablet can utilize when traveling. Turning on airplane mode will disable all wireless connections on the device, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular data. This will prevent the user from accessing any online services or applications on the tablet. Configuring the device to use a static IP address will assign a fixed IP address to the device instead of obtaining one dynamically from a DHCP server. This will not affect the amount of cellular data the device uses, and it may cause IP conflicts or connectivity issues on some networks. Enabling the Windows Defender Firewall will block or allow incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined or custom rules. This will not reduce the amount of cellular data the device uses, and it may interfere with some apps or services that require network access.

A department manager submits a help desk ticket to request the migration of a printer's port utilization from USB to Ethernet so multiple users can access the printer. This will be a new network printer, thus a new IP address allocation is required. Which of the following should happen immediately before network use is authorized?

- A. Document the date and time of the change.
- B. Submit a change request form
- C. Determine the risk level of this change
- D. Request an unused IP address.

Answer: B

Explanation: The correct answer is B. Submit a change request form. A change request form is a document that describes the proposed change, the reason for the change, the expected benefits and impacts, the risks and mitigation strategies, the implementation plan, and the approval process. A change request form is an essential part of change management best practices, as it helps to ensure that the change is well-planned, communicated, and authorized before it is implemented.

A change request form should be submitted immediately before network use is authorized, because it provides the necessary information and justification for the change to the relevant stakeholders, such as the network administrator, the IT manager, and the department manager. The change request form also allows the stakeholders to review and approve or reject the change, or request more information or modifications. The change request form also serves as a record of the change history and status.

Outlook, that may prevent them from opening or working properly. This can happen if the update changes some system files or settings that Outlook relies on, or if the update conflicts with some Outlook add-ins or extensions. To fix this, the technician can try some of these troubleshooting steps:

- Start Outlook in safe mode and disable add-ins. Safe mode is a way of starting Outlook without any add-ins or extensions that may interfere with its functionality. To start Outlook in safe mode, press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Outlook icon. You should see a message asking if you want to start Outlook in safe mode. Click Yes. If Outlook works fine in safe mode, it means one of the add-ins is causing the problem. To disable add-ins, go to File > Options > Add-ins. In the Manage drop-down list, select COM Add-ins and click Go. Uncheck any add-ins that you don’t need and click OK. Restart Outlook normally and check if the issue is resolved.
- Create a new Outlook profile. A profile is a set of settings and information that Outlook uses to manage your email accounts and data. Sometimes, a profile can get corrupted or damaged and cause Outlook to malfunction. To create a new profile, go to Control Panel > Mail > Show Profiles. Click Add and follow the instructions to set up a new profile with your email account. Make sure to select the option to use the new profile as the default one. Restart Outlook and check if the issue is resolved.
- Repair your Outlook data files. Data files are files that store your email messages, contacts, calendar events, and other items on your computer. Sometimes, data files can get corrupted or damaged and cause Outlook to malfunction. To repair your data files, you can use a tool called scanpst.exe, which is located in the same folder where Outlook is installed (usually C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16). To use scanpst.exe, close Outlook and locate the tool in the folder. Double-click on it and browse to the location of your data file (usually C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook). Select the file and click Start to begin the scanning and repairing process. When it’s done, restart Outlook and check if the issue is resolved.
- Run the /resetnavpane command. The navigation pane is the panel on the left side of Outlook that shows your folders and accounts. Sometimes, the navigation pane can get corrupted or damaged and cause Outlook to malfunction. To reset the navigation pane, press Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box, or open the Command Prompt. Type outlook.exe /resetnavpane and hit Enter. This will clear and regenerate the navigation pane settings for Outlook. Restart Outlook and check if the issue is resolved.

During a network outage, a technician discovers a new network switch that was not listed in the

support documentation. The switch was installed during a recent change window when a new office was

added to the environment. Which of the following would most likely prevent this type of mismatch after next

month's change window?

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>A.</td>
<td>Performing annual network topology reviews</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B.</td>
<td>Requiring all network changes include updating the network diagrams</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C.</td>
<td>Allowing network changes once per year</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D.</td>
<td>Routinely backing up switch configuration files</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

Answer: B

Explanation: This would ensure that the support documentation reflects the current state

of the network and prevents any confusion or mismatch during a network outage. Updating the network

diagrams is also one of the best practices for network documentation, as

stated in the Official CompTIA A+ Core 2 Study Guide1. The other options are not as effective or feasible

as option B. Performing annual network topology reviews is too infrequent and may not capture recent

changes. Allowing network changes once per year is too restrictive and may not meet the business needs.

Routinely backing up switch configuration files is important, but it does not help with identifying new

switches or devices on the network.

D. Get authorization from the manager.

Answer: D

Explanation: The next step that the technician should do before taking the computer off site for repair is to get authorization from the manager. Getting authorization from the manager is important because it ensures that the technician has permission and approval to remove the computer from the premises and perform the repair work off site. Getting authorization from the manager can also help document and communicate the reason and duration of the repair and avoid any misunderstanding or conflict with the user or the organization. Removing the HDD and then sending the computer for repair may not be feasible or necessary if the issue is not related to the HDD or if the HDD contains essential data or software for the repair. Checking corporate policies for guidance may be a good step but it does not replace getting authorization from the manager who is responsible for the computer and its data. Deleting the sensitive information before the computer leaves the building may not be possible or advisable if the issue prevents access to the data or if the data is needed for troubleshooting or recovery purposes.

A technician downloaded a software program to a network share. When the technician attempts to copy the program to the Windows tablet for installation, the technician receives an error. Which of the following is the best procedure for the technician to use to complete the assignment?

- A. Copy the program file to a USB drive and install.
- B. Burn the program file to a CD and install.
- C. Format the HDD and then do the installation.
- D. Replace the HDD and then do the installation.

Answer: A

Explanation:

Copying the program file to a USB drive and installing it from there is the simplest and most reliable way to transfer the software from the network share to the Windows tablet. The other options are either unnecessary, risky, or impractical. Burning the program file to a CD requires a CD burner and a CD reader, which may not be available on the tablet. Formatting or replacing the HDD will erase all the data and settings on the tablet, which is not advisable unless there is a backup or a serious problem. Moreover, formatting or replacing the HDD will not solve the issue of copying the program file from the network share.

Pathping is a utility that combines the functions of ping and tracert, which are two other command-line tools that test network connectivity and latency. Pathping sends packets to each router on the path to a destination and then computes results based on the packets returned from each hop. Pathping can show the route taken by the packets, the number of hops, the latency of each hop, and the packet loss percentage. This information can help the systems administrator identify where the network problem occurs and how severe it is. Ipconfig, arp, and nslookup are not as useful as pathping for this task. Ipconfig shows the configuration of the network interface card, such as IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. Arp shows the mapping of IP addresses to MAC addresses in the local network. Nslookup queries DNS servers for domain name resolution.

# 316. Which of the following commands can a technician use to get the MAC address of a Linux distribution?

- A. net use
- B. ifconfig
- C. netstat
- D. ping

Answer: B

Explanation: The ifconfig command is a tool for configuring network interfaces that any Linux system administrator should know. It is used to bring interfaces up or down, assign and remove addresses and routes, manage ARP cache, and much more. One of the information that ifconfig can display is the MAC address of each network interface, which is a unique identifier of the physical layer of the network device. The MAC address is usually shown as a hexadecimal string separated by colons, such as 00:0c:29:3f:5c:1f. To get the MAC address of a Linux distribution, a technician can use the ifconfig command without any arguments, which will show the details of all the active network interfaces, or specify the name of a particular interface, such as eth0 or wlan0, to show only the details of that interface.

A malicious file was executed automatically when a flash drive was plugged in. Which of the following features would prevent this type of incident?

- A. Disabling UAC
- B. Restricting local administrators
- C. Enabling UPnP
- D. Turning off AutoPlay

Answer: D

Explanation: AutoPlay is a feature that automatically runs programs or files when a removable media device, such as a flash drive, is plugged in. This can be exploited by malware authors who place malicious files on flash drives that execute automatically when inserted into a computer. Turning off AutoPlay can prevent this type of incident by requiring the user to manually open or run files from removable media devices.

A corporate smartphone was stored for five months after setup. During this time, the company did not have any system updates. When the phone is turned on, an application runs, but it crashes intermittently. Which of the following should a technician do next?

- A. Restart the phone.
- B. Reimage the OS.
- C. Reinstall the application.
- D. Clear the cache.

Answer: C

# Explanation:

Reinstalling the application is the best option to fix the intermittent crashing of the application on the corporate smartphone. Reinstalling the application will ensure that the latest version of the app is installed, which may have bug fixes and compatibility updates that can resolve the crashing issue.

Reinstalling the app will also clear any corrupted or outdated data or cache that may cause the app to malfunction.

The other options are not as effective or appropriate as reinstalling the app. Restarting the phone may temporarily fix the issue, but it will not address the root cause of the app crashing, which may be related to the app itself or its data. Reimaging the OS is a drastic and unnecessary measure that will erase all the data and settings on the phone and restore it to its factory state. This will also remove all the other apps and files that may be important for the corporate use of the phone. Clearing the cache may help to free up some space and improve the performance of the app, but it will not update the app or fix any bugs that may cause the app to crash.

A technician is working on a Windows 10 PC that has unwanted applications starting on boot. Which of the following tools should the technician use to disable applications on startup?

- A. System Configuration
- B. Task Manager
- C. Performance Monitor
- D. Group Policy Editor

Answer: B

Explanation: Task Manager is the best tool to use to disable applications on startup in Windows 10. Task Manager is a built-in utility that shows the current processes, performance, and users on a system. It also has a Startup tab that lists the applications that run on boot and their impact on the system. The technician can use Task Manager to disable or enable any application on startup by right-clicking on it and selecting the appropriate option. System Configuration, Performance Monitor, and Group Policy Editor are other tools that can be used to manage system settings, but they are not as simple or convenient as Task Manager for this task.

D. The system requires BIOS updates

Answer: B

Explanation:

The most likely reason that the system is not utilizing all the available RAM is that the system is utilizing a 32-bit OS. A 32-bit OS is an operating system that uses 32 bits to address memory locations and perform calculations. A 32-bit OS can only support up to 4GB of RAM, and some of that RAM may be reserved for hardware devices or system functions, leaving less than 4GB of usable RAM for applications and processes. A 32-bit OS cannot recognize or utilize more than 4GB of RAM, even if more RAM is installed on the system. To utilize all the available RAM, the system needs to use a 64-bit OS, which can support much more RAM than a 32-bit OS. The system missing updates may cause some performance or compatibility issues, but it does not affect the amount of usable RAM on the system. The system’s memory failing may cause some errors or crashes, but it does not affect the amount of usable RAM on the system. The system requiring BIOS updates may cause some configuration or compatibility issues, but it does not affect the amount of usable RAM on the system.

A small business owner wants to install newly purchased software on all networked PCs. The network is not configured as a domain, and the owner wants to use the easiest method possible. Which of the following is the MOST deficient way for the owner to install the application?

- A. Use a network share to share the installation files.
- B. Save software to an external hard drive to install.
- C. Create an imaging USB for each PC.
- D. Install the software from the vendor's website

Certify For Sure with IT Exam Dumps

A. Screen resolution

B. Screen zoom

C. Screen timeout

D. Screen brightness

E. Screen damage

F. Screen motion smoothness

Answer: C,D

Explanation: Screen timeout is the setting that determines how long the screen stays on after the user stops interacting with the phone. Screen brightness is the setting that determines how much light the screen emits. Both of these settings affect the battery life of the phone, as keeping the screen on longer and brighter consumes more power than turning it off sooner and dimmer. A technician should check these settings first to troubleshoot the issue of low battery life and adjust them accordingly. Screen resolution, screen zoom, screen damage, and screen motion smoothness are not settings that directly affect the battery life or the screen staying on for a long time.

A user installed a new computer game. Upon starting the game, the user notices the frame rates are low. Which of the following should the user upgrade to resolve the issue?

- A. Hard drive
- B. Graphics card
- C. Random-access memory
- D. Monitor

Answer: B

Explanation: A graphics card, also known as a video card or a GPU (graphics processing unit), is a component that can affect the performance of a computer game. A graphics card is responsible for rendering and displaying graphics on the screen, such as images, animations, and effects. A computer game may require a high level of graphics processing power to run smoothly and achieve high frame rates, which are the number of frames per second (FPS) that the game can display. Upgrading to a better graphics card can improve the performance of a computer game by increasing its graphics quality and frame rates. Hard drive, random-access memory, and monitor are not components that can directly improve the performance of a computer game.

is extremely high. Which of the following types of malware is MOST likely to blame?

- A. Spyware
- B. Cryptominer
- C. Ransomware
- D. Boot sector virus

Answer: B

Explanation: The type of malware that is most likely to blame for a PC running more slowly than usual and having an extremely high GPU temperature is a “cryptominer”. Cryptominers are a type of malware that use the resources of a computer to mine cryptocurrency. This can cause the computer to run more slowly than usual and can cause the GPU temperature to rise. Spyware is a type of malware that is used to spy on a user’s activities, but it does not typically cause high GPU temperatures. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a user’s files and demands payment to unlock them, but it does not typically cause high GPU temperatures. Boot sector viruses are a type of malware that infects the boot sector of a hard drive, but they do not typically cause high GPU temperatures.

368. A new employee is having difficulties using a laptop with a docking station. The laptop is connected to the docking station, and the laptop is closed.

- A. Hibernate
- B. Sleep/suspend
- C. Choose what closing the lid does
- D. Turn on fast startup

Answer: C

Explanation: The correct answer is C. Choose what closing the lid does. This option allows you to configure how the laptop behaves when you close the lid, such as whether it goes to sleep, hibernates, shuts down, or does nothing. To access this option, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to Settings > System > Power &#x26; sleep.
2. Click on Additional power settings on the right side.
3. Click on Choose what closing the lid does on the left side.

Under When I close the lid, select Do nothing for both On battery and Plugged in.

Click on Save changes.

This will prevent the laptop from going to sleep when you close the lid while it is connected to the docking station and the external monitor.

Hibernate, sleep/suspend, and turn on fast startup are not the options that should be configured to fix the issue. Hibernate and sleep/suspend are both power-saving modes that allow you to resume your work without losing any data. However, they also turn off the display and other components of the laptop, which means you will not be able to use the external monitor when the laptop is closed. Turn on fast startup is a feature that reduces the boot time of Windows by saving some system information to a file when you shut down. It does not affect how the laptop behaves when you close the lid.

A laptop user is visually impaired and requires a different cursor color. Which of the following OS utilities is used to change the color of the cursor?

- A. Keyboard

# Explanation:

Mobile device multifactor authentication (MFA) is a method of verifying a user’s identity by requiring two or more factors, such as something the user knows (e.g., password, PIN, security question), something the user has (e.g., smartphone, OTP app, security key), or something the user is (e.g., fingerprint, face, iris).

The combination of fingerprint and password meets the requirements for mobile device MFA because it uses two different factors: something the user is (fingerprint) and something the user knows (password). The other combinations do not meet the requirements because they use only one factor: something the user knows (password or PIN) or something the user does (swipe).

# Question 1

B. Touch pad

C. Ease of Access Center

D. Display settings

Answer: C

# Explanation:

The OS utility used to change the color of the cursor in Windows is Ease of Access Center.

The user can change the cursor color by opening the Settings app, selecting Accessibility in the left sidebar, selecting Mouse pointer and touch under Vision, and choosing one of the cursor options. The user can select Custom to pick a color and use the Size slider to make the cursor larger or smaller.

The Ease of Access Center in the Windows OS provides accessibility options for users with disabilities or impairments. One of these options allows the user to change the color and size of the cursor, making it more visible and easier to locate on the screen. The Keyboard and Touchpad settings do not offer the option to change cursor color, and Display Settings are used to adjust the resolution and other properties of the display. Therefore, C is the best answer. This information is covered in the Comptia A+ Core2 documents/guide under the Accessibility section.

- B. Virtualization
- C. Domain access
- D. Workgroup

Answer: D

Explanation: A workgroup is a network configuration that allows computers to communicate and share resources with each other without requiring a centralized server or domain controller. A workgroup is suitable for small office environments where there are only a few computers and users who need simple file and printer sharing. A workgroup does not have centralized management or security policies, which may be desirable for larger or more complex networks. Print server, virtualization, and domain access are not network configurations that are most likely used in a small office environment.

A large company is changing its password length requirements. The Chief Information Officer is mandating that passwords now be at least 12 characters long, instead of 10. Which of the following should be used to adjust this setting?

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>A.</td>
<td>Group Policy</td>

A. .bat
B. .dll
C. .ps1
D. .txt

# Answer: A

# Explanation:

The .bat file type would be used in the Windows Startup folder to automate copying a personal storage table (.pst) file to a network drive at log-in. A .bat file is a batch file that contains a series of commands that can be executed by the command interpreter. A .bat file can be used to perform various tasks, such as copying, moving, deleting, or renaming files or directories. A .bat file can be placed in the Windows Startup folder to run automatically when a user logs in to the system. A .bat file can use the copy command to copy a .pst file from a local drive to a network drive. A .pst file is a personal storage table file that contains email messages, contacts, calendars, and other data from Microsoft Outlook. A .pst file can be backed up to a network drive for security or recovery purposes. The .dll, .ps1, and .txt file types are not used in the Windows Startup folder to automate copying a .pst file to a network drive at log-in. A .dll file is a dynamic link library file that contains code or data that can be shared by multiple programs. A .dll file cannot be executed directly by the user or the system. A .ps1 file is a PowerShell script file that contains

A user's Windows computer seems to work well at the beginning of the day. However, its performance degrades throughout the day, and the system freezes when several applications are open. Which of the following should a technician do to resolve the issue? (Select two).

- A. Install the latest GPU drivers.
- B. Reinstall the OS.
- C. Increase the RAM.
- D. Increase the hard drive space.
- E. Uninstall unnecessary software.
- F. Disable scheduled tasks.

Answer: C, E

# Explanation:

The most likely causes of the user’s Windows computer performance degradation and freezing are insufficient RAM and excessive software running in the background. Therefore, the technician should do the following to resolve the issue:

- Increase the RAM. RAM is the memory that the computer uses to store and run applications and processes. If the RAM is not enough to handle the workload, the computer will use the hard drive as a virtual memory, which is much slower and can cause performance issues. Increasing the RAM will allow the computer to run more applications and processes smoothly and avoid freezing. The technician should check the system requirements of the applications that the user needs to run, and install additional RAM modules that are compatible with the motherboard and the existing RAM. The technician should also make sure that the system is managing the page file size automatically, or adjust it manually to optimize the virtual memory usage.
- Uninstall unnecessary software. Software that the user does not need or use can take up valuable disk space and system resources, and can interfere with the performance of other applications. Some software may also run in the background or start automatically when the computer boots up, which can slow down the system and cause freezing. The technician should help the user to identify and uninstall unnecessary software from the control panel or the settings app, and disable unnecessary startup programs from the task manager or the system configuration tool. The technician should also check for and remove viruses.

Explanation: The best way to resolve the issue is to move factory applications to external memory. This will free up some space on the phone’s internal storage, which is required for updating the phone. To do this, you can follow these steps1:

- Insert a microSD card into your phone if you don’t have one already.
- Go to Settings > Apps and tap on the app you want to move.
- Tap on Storage and then on Change.
- Select the SD card option and tap on Move.

You may need to repeat this process for multiple apps until you have enough space to update your phone.

Alternatively, you can also clear the cache and data of some apps, or uninstall the apps that you don’t use frequently. You can find more information on how to fix insufficient storage error on your phone in these articles23. I hope this helps.

391. A developer reports that a workstation's database file extensions have been changed from .db to .enc. The developer is also unable to open the database files manually. Which of the following is the best option for recovering the data?

- A. Accessing a restore point
- B. Rebooting into safe mode
- C. Utilizing the backups
- D. Using an AV to scan the affected files

Answer: C

Explanation: The scenario described in the question suggests that the workstation has been infected by a ransomware, which is a type of malware that encrypts the files on the target system and demands a ransom for the decryption key12. The file extension .enc is commonly used by some ransomware variants to mark the encrypted files34. The developer is unable to open the database files manually because they are encrypted and require the decryption key, which is usually held by the attacker.

The best option for recovering the data is to utilize the backups, assuming that the backups are recent, valid, and not affected by the ransomware. Backups are copies of the data that are stored in a separate location or device, and can be used to restore the data in case of a disaster, such as a ransomware attack. By restoring the data from the backups, the developer can avoid paying the ransom and losing the data permanently.

The No.1 IT Certification Dumps

Certify For Sure with IT Exam Dumps

Accessing a restore point is not a good option, because restore points are snapshots of the system settings and configuration, not the data files. Restore points can help to undo some system changes, such as installing a faulty driver or software, but they cannot recover the encrypted data files.

Rebooting into safe mode is also not a good option, because safe mode is a diagnostic mode that allows the system to run with minimal drivers and services, but it does not affect the data files. Safe mode can help to troubleshoot some system issues, such as malware infections, but it cannot decrypt the data files.

Using an AV to scan the affected files is also not a good option, because an AV is a software that can detect and remove some malware, but it cannot decrypt the data files. An AV can help to prevent or remove some ransomware infections, but it cannot recover the encrypted data files.

Certify For Sure with IT Exam Dumps

# Question 1

A. GPT

B. MBR

C. FAT32

Answer: B

# Explanation:

GPT is the correct answer for this question. GPT stands for GUID Partition Table, and it is a partition style that supports up to 128 primary partitions and up to 18 exabytes of disk size per partition. GPT also uses a unique identifier for each partition and provides better data protection and recovery. GPT is suitable for partitioning a hard disk that has five primary partitions with 4TB of free space each. EFS, MBR, and FAT32 are not correct answers for this question. EFS stands for Encrypting File System, and it is a feature that allows encrypting files and folders on NTFS volumes. EFS is not a partition style, but rather a file system attribute. MBR stands for Master Boot Record, and it is an older partition style that supports up to four primary partitions and up to 2TB of disk size per partition. MBR cannot handle five primary partitions with 4TB of free space each. FAT32 stands for File Allocation Table 32, and it is a file system that supports up to 32GB of disk size per partition and up to 4GB of file size. FAT32 is not a partition style, but rather a file system type.

✑ Open the browser that is sending the notifications, such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox.

✑ Go to the browser settings or options menu, and look for the privacy and security section.

✑ Find the option to manage site permissions or notifications, and click on it.

✑ You will see a list of sites that are allowed or blocked from sending notifications to the browser and the Action Center. You can either block all sites from sending notifications, or select specific sites that you want to block or allow.

✑ Save the changes and close the browser settings. This solution is better than the other options because:

- ✑ Running a full antivirus scan on the computer (B) is not necessary, as the advertisement notifications are not malicious or harmful, and they are not caused by a virus or malware infection. Running a scan will not stop the notifications from appearing, and it will consume system resources and time.
- ✑ Disabling all Action Center notifications (C) is not advisable, as the Action Center is a useful feature that shows notifications and alerts from various apps and system events, such as email, calendar, security, updates, etc. Disabling all notifications will make the user miss important information and reminders, and reduce the functionality of the Action Center.
- ✑ Moving specific site notifications from Allowed to Block (D) is not the best solution, as it will only stop the notifications from some sites, but not from others. The user may still receive advertisement notifications from other sites that are not blocked, or from new sites that are added to the Allowed list. This solution will also require the user to manually manage the list of sites, which can be tedious and time-consuming.

- A. Educate the end user on best practices for security.
- B. Quarantine the host in the antivirus system.
- C. Investigate how the system was infected with malware.
- D. Create a system restore point.

Answer: A

# Explanation:

Educating the end user on best practices for security is the next step that the technician should take after successfully removing malicious software from an infected computer. Educating the end user on best practices for security is an important part of preventing future infections and mitigating risks. The technician should explain to the end user how to avoid common sources of malware, such as phishing emails, malicious websites, or removable media. The technician should also advise the end user to use strong passwords, update software regularly, enable antivirus and firewall protection, and backup data frequently.

Educating the end user on best practices for security can help the end user become more aware and responsible for their own security and reduce the likelihood of recurrence of malware infections.

Quarantining the host in the antivirus system, investigating how the system was infected with malware, and creating a system restore point are not the next steps that the technician should take after successfully removing malicious software from an infected computer. Quarantining the host in the antivirus system is a step that the technician should take before removing malicious software from an infected computer. Quarantining the host in the antivirus system means isolating the infected computer from the network or other devices to prevent the spread of malware.

# 407. Which of the following command options is used to display hidden files and directories?

- A. -a
- B. -s
- C. -lh
- D. -t

Answer: A

Explanation: The -a option is used to display hidden files and directories in a command-line interface. Hidden files and directories are those that start with a dot (.) and are normally not shown by default. The -a option stands for “all” and shows all files and directories, including the hidden ones. The -a option can be used with commands such as ls, dir, or find to list or search for hidden files and directories. The -s, -lh, and -t options are not used to display hidden files and directories. The -s option stands for “size” and shows the size of files or directories in bytes. The -lh option stands for “long human-readable” and shows the size of files or directories in a more readable format, such as KB, MB, or GB. The -t option stands for “time” and sorts the files or directories by modification time.

A network administrator is deploying a client certificate to be used for Wi-Fi access for all devices in an organization. The certificate will be used in conjunction with the user's existing username and password.

Which of the following BEST describes the security benefits realized after this deployment?

- A. Multifactor authentication will be forced for Wi-Fi.
- B. All Wi-Fi traffic will be encrypted in transit.
- C. Eavesdropping attempts will be prevented.
- D. Rogue access points will not connect.

Answer: B

Explanation: The security benefits realized after deploying a client certificate to be used for Wi-Fi access for all devices in an organization are that all Wi-Fi traffic will be encrypted in transit. This means that any data transmitted over the Wi-Fi network will be protected from eavesdropping attempts. Rogue access points will not connect to the network because they will not have the client certificate. However, multifactor authentication will not be forced for Wi-Fi because the client certificate is being used in conjunction with the user’s existing username and password.

Which of the following would allow physical access to a restricted area while maintaining a record of events?

- A. Hard token
- B. Access control vestibule
- C. Key fob
- D. Door Lock

Answer: B

Explanation: Access control vestibule is the correct answer for this question. An access control vestibule is a physical security device that consists of two doors that form an enclosed space between them. The first door opens only after verifying the identity of the person entering, such as by using a card reader, biometric scanner, or keypad. The second door opens only after the first door closes, creating a buffer zone that prevents unauthorized access or tailgating. An access control vestibule also maintains a record of events, such as who entered or exited, when, and how. Hard token, key fob, and door lock are not sufficient to meet the requirements of this question. A hard token is a device that generates a one-time password or code for.

During an enterprise rollout of a new application, a technician needs to validate compliance with an application's EULA while also reducing the number of licenses to manage. Which of the following licenses would best accomplish this goal?

- A. Personal use license
- B. Corporate use license
- C. Open-source license
- D. Non-expiring license

Answer: B

Explanation: A corporate use license, also known as a volume license, is a type of software license that allows an organization to purchase and use multiple copies of a software product with a single license key. A corporate use license can help validate compliance with an application’s EULA (end-user license agreement), which is a legal contract that defines the terms and conditions of using the software. A corporate use license can also reduce the number of licenses to manage, as it eliminates the need to activate and track individual licenses for each copy of the software. Personal use license, open-source license, and non-expiring license are not types of licenses that can best accomplish this goal.

A user receives an error message from an online banking site that states the following:

Your connection is not private. Authority invalid.

Which of the following actions should the user take NEXT?

- A. Proceed to the site.
- B. Use a different browser.
- C. Report the error to the bank.
- D. Reinstall the browser.

Answer: C

# Explanation:

The error message “Your connection is not private. Authority invalid.” means that the web browser cannot verify the identity or security of the website’s SSL certificate. This could indicate that the website has been compromised, has a configuration error, or has an expired or invalid certificate. The user should not proceed to the site or use a different browser, as this could expose their sensitive information to potential attackers. The user should also not reinstall the browser, as this is unlikely to fix the error and could cause data loss. The best action for the user to take is to report the error to the bank and wait for them to resolve it.

requirement to retain this data for many years. Which of the following backup methods would BEST meet the requirements?

1. A daily, incremental backup that is saved to the corporate file server
2. An additional, secondary hard drive in a mirrored RAID configuration
3. A full backup of the data that is stored off site in cold storage
4. Weekly, differential backups that are stored in a cloud-hosting provider

Answer: C

Explanation:

According to CompTIA A+ Core 2 objectives, a full backup stored off-site provides the greatest protection against data loss in the event of a ransomware attack or other data disaster. By storing the backup in a separate physical location, it is less likely to be affected by the same event that could cause data loss on the original system. Cold storage is a term used for data archiving, which typically refers to a long-term storage solution that is used for retaining data that is infrequently accessed, but still needs to be kept for regulatory or compliance reasons.

423. A user tries to access commonly used web pages but is redirected to unexpected websites. Clearing the web browser cache does not resolve the issue. Which of the following should a technician investigate NEXT to resolve the issue?

1. Enable firewall ACLs.
2. Examine the localhost file entries.
3. Verify the routing tables.
4. Update the antivirus definitions.

Answer: B

Explanation: A possible cause of the user being redirected to unexpected websites is that the localhost file entries have been modified by malware or hackers to point to malicious or unwanted websites. The localhost file is a text file that maps hostnames to IP addresses and can override DNS settings. By examining the localhost file entries, a technician can identify and remove any suspicious or unauthorized entries that may cause the redirection issue. Enabling firewall ACLs may not resolve the issue if the firewall rules do not block the malicious or unwanted websites. Verifying the routing tables may not resolve the issue if the routing configuration is correct and does not affect the web traffic. Updating the antivirus definitions may help, but it is not the first step to investigate in this scenario.

# Question 425

A branch office suspects a machine contains ransomware. Which of the following mitigation steps should a technician take first?

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>A.</td>
<td>Disable System Restore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B.</td>
<td>Remediate the system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C.</td>
<td>Educate the system user.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D.</td>
<td>Quarantine the system.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

Answer: D

Explanation: The first mitigation step that a technician should take when a machine is suspected to contain ransomware is to quarantine the system. This means isolating the infected machine from the network and other devices, to prevent the ransomware from spreading and encrypting more data. The technician can quarantine the system by disconnecting the network cable, turning off the wireless adapter, or using firewall rules to block the traffic from and to the machine.

This step is more important than the other options because:

- Disabling System Restore (A) is not a priority, as it will not stop the ransomware from running or

spreading. System Restore is a feature that allows users to restore their system to a previous state, but it may not work if the ransomware has encrypted or deleted the restore points. Moreover, disabling System Restore may prevent the user from recovering some data or settings in the future13.

✑ Remediating the system (B) is the ultimate goal, but it cannot be done before quarantining the system. Remediating the system means removing the ransomware, restoring the data, and fixing the vulnerabilities that allowed the attack. However, this process requires careful analysis, planning, and execution, and it may not be possible if the ransomware is still active and communicating with the attackers. Therefore, the technician should first isolate the system and then proceed with the remediation steps12.

✑ Educating the system user (C) is a preventive measure, but it is not a mitigation step. Educating the system user means raising awareness and providing training on how to avoid ransomware attacks, such as by recognizing phishing emails, avoiding suspicious links or attachments, and updating and patching the system regularly. However, this step will not help if the system is already infected, and it may not be effective if the user is not willing or able to follow the best practices. Therefore, the technician should focus on resolving the current incident and then educate the user as part of the recovery plan14.

A company implemented a BYOD policy and would like to reduce data disclosure caused by malware that may infect these devices. Which of the following should the company deploy to address these concerns?

- A. UAC
- B. MDM
- C. LDAP
- D. SSO

Answer: B

# Explanation:

MDM stands for mobile device management, which is a type of software solution that allows remote management and security of mobile devices. MDM can help a company reduce data disclosure caused by malware that may infect these devices by enforcing security policies, such as encryption, password protection, antivirus software, and remote wipe. MDM can also monitor and control the access of personal devices to corporate data and networks. UAC stands for user account control, which is a feature of Windows that prompts users for permission or an administrator password before making changes that affect the system. UAC may not be effective in preventing malware infection or data disclosure on personal devices. LDAP stands for lightweight directory access protocol, which is a protocol for accessing and managing information stored in a directory service, such as user names and passwords. LDAP does not directly address the issue of malware infection or data disclosure on personal devices. SSO stands for single sign-on, which is a feature that allows users to access multiple applications or services with one set of credentials. SSO may not prevent malware infection or data disclosure on personal devices, and may even increase the risk if the credentials are compromised.

- A. Ransomware
- B. Failed OS updates
- C. Adware
- D. Missing system files

Answer: B

Explanation: The most likely reason for the antivirus protection on a company laptop being out of date is failed OS updates. Antivirus software relies on the operating system to function properly. If the operating system is not up-to-date, the antivirus software may not function properly and may not be able to receive the latest virus definitions and updates. Therefore, it is important to keep the operating system up-to-date to ensure the antivirus software is functioning properly.

Certify For Sure with IT Exam Dumps

C. Least privilege

D. Mobile device management

Answer: C

Explanation: Least privilege is the principle that is used to ensure users have the appropriate level of access to perform their job functions. Least privilege means granting users only the minimum amount of access rights and permissions they need to perform their tasks, and nothing more. Least privilege reduces the risk of unauthorized access, data leakage, malware infection, or accidental damage by limiting what users can do on the system or network. Access control list, multifactor authentication, and mobile device management are not principles, but rather mechanisms or methods that can implement least privilege.

Access control list is a list that specifies the users or groups that are allowed or denied access to a resource, such as a file, folder, or printer. Multifactor authentication is a method that requires users to provide two or more pieces of evidence to prove their identity, such as a password, a token, or a biometric factor. Mobile device management is a tool that allows managing and securing mobile devices, such as smartphones or tablets, that are used by employees to access corporate data or applications.

An employee calls the help desk regarding an issue with a laptop PC. After a Windows update, the user can no longer use certain locally attached devices, and a reboot has not fixed the issue. Which of the following should the technician perform to fix the issue?

- A. Disable the Windows Update service.
- B. Check for updates.
- C. Restore hidden updates.
- D. Rollback updates.

Answer: D

# Explanation:

The technician should perform a rollback of the Windows update that caused the issue with the locally attached devices. A rollback is a process of uninstalling an update and restoring the previous version of the system. This can help to fix any compatibility or performance issues caused by the update1. To rollback an update, the technician can use the Settings app, the Control Panel, or the System Restore feature. The technician should also check for any device driver updates that might be needed after rolling back the update. Disabling the Windows Update service is not a good practice, as it can prevent the system from receiving important security and feature updates. Checking for updates might not fix the issue, as the update that caused the issue might still be installed. Restoring hidden updates is not relevant, as it only applies to updates that have been hidden by the user to prevent them from being installed2.

440. Users access files in the department share. When a user creates a new subfolder, only that user can access the folder and its files. Which of the following will MOST likely allow all users to access the new folders?

- A. Assigning share permissions
- B. Enabling inheritance
- C. Requiring multifactor authentication
- D. Removing archive attribute

Answer: B

Explanation: Enabling inheritance is a method that allows new subfolders to inherit the permissions and settings from their parent folder. If users can access files in the department share, but not in the new subfolders created by other users, it may indicate that inheritance is disabled and that each new subfolder has its own permissions and settings that restrict access to only the creator. Enabling inheritance can help resolve this issue by allowing all users to access the new subfolders with the same permissions and settings as the department share. Assigning share permissions, requiring multifactor authentication, and removing archive attribute are not methods that can most likely allow all users to access the new folders.

# Question

When the specialist connects to Wi-Fi, the specialist realizes the insecure network has open authentication. The technician needs to secure the vendor's sensitive data. Which of the following should the specialist do FIRST to protect the company's data?

- A. Manually configure an IP address, a subnet mask, and a default gateway.
- B. Connect to the vendor's network using a VPN.
- C. Change the network location to private.
- D. Configure MFA on the network.

Answer: B

# Explanation

The first thing that the specialist should do to protect the company’s data on an insecure network with open authentication is to connect to the vendor’s network using a VPN. A VPN stands for Virtual Private Network and is a technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection over a public or untrusted network. A VPN can protect the company’s data by preventing eavesdropping, interception or modification of the network traffic by unauthorized parties. A VPN can also provide access to the company’s internal network and resources remotely.

Manually configuring an IP address, a subnet mask and a default gateway may not be necessary or possible if the vendor’s network uses DHCP to assign network configuration parameters automatically. Manually configuring an IP address, a subnet mask and a default gateway does not protect the company’s data from network attacks or threats. Changing the network location to private may not be advisable or effective if the vendor’s network is a public or untrusted network. Changing the network location to private does not protect the company’s data from network attacks or threats. Configuring MFA on the network may not be feasible or sufficient if the vendor’s network has open authentication and does not support or require MFA. Configuring MFA on the network does not protect the company’s data from network attacks or threats.

# Question

A user clicks a link in an email. A warning message in the user's browser states the site's certificate cannot be verified. Which of the following is the most appropriate action for a technician to take?

1. A. Click proceed.
2. B. Report the employee to the human resources department for violating company policy.
3. C. Restore the computer from the last known backup.
4. D. Close the browser window and report the email to IT security.

# Answer

Answer: D

# Explanation

A warning message in the user’s browser stating the site’s certificate cannot be verified indicates that the site may be insecure, fraudulent, or malicious. This could be a sign of a phishing attempt, where the sender of the email tries to trick the user into clicking a link that leads to a fake website that mimics a legitimate one, in order to steal the user’s personal or financial information. The most appropriate action is to close the browser window and report the email to IT security.

The action for a technician to take in this situation is to close the browser window and report the email to IT security, who can investigate the source and content of the email, and take the necessary steps to protect the user and the network from potential harm. Clicking proceed could expose the user to malware, identity theft, or data breach. Reporting the employee to the human resources department for violating company policy is unnecessary and harsh, as the user may not have been aware of the phishing attempt or the company policy. Restoring the computer from the last known backup is premature and ineffective, as the user may not have been infected by anything, and the backup may not remove the email or the link from the user’s inbox.

Certify For Sure with IT Exam Dumps

# D. SSH

Answer: A

# Explanation:

VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a remote access tool that allows the technician to access and control various Windows, Linux, and macOS desktops on the company LAN using a graphical user interface. VNC does not require an external internet connection, as it works over a local network or a VPN. VNC uses a client-server model, where the server runs on the remote desktop and the client connects to it from another device. VNC can transmit the keyboard and mouse events from the client to the server, and the screen updates from the server to the client, enabling the technician to interact with the remote desktop as if it were local12.

VNC is a better option than the other choices because:

- RMM (Remote Monitoring and Management) (B) is not a single software solution, but a category of software solutions that enable IT professionals to remotely monitor, manage, and troubleshoot multiple devices and networks. RMM software may include remote access tools, but also other features such as patch management, backup and recovery, security, reporting, and automation. RMM software may require an external internet connection, as it often relies on cloud-based services or web-based consoles34.
- RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) (C) is a remote access tool that allows the technician to access and control Windows desktops on the company LAN using a graphical user interface. However, RDP is not compatible with Linux or macOS desktops, unless they have third-party software installed that can emulate or translate the RDP protocol. RDP also has some security and performance issues, such as encryption vulnerabilities, bandwidth consumption, and latency problems56.
- SSH (Secure Shell) (D) is a remote access tool that allows the technician to access and control various Windows, Linux, and macOS desktops on the company LAN using a command-line interface. SSH does not require an external internet connection, as it works over a local network or a VPN. SSH uses encryption and authentication to secure the communication between the client and the server. However, SSH does not provide a graphical user interface, which may limit the functionality and usability of the remote desktop7.

A technician sees a file that is requesting payment to a cryptocurrency address. Which of the following should the technician do first?

- A. Quarantine the computer.
- B. Disable System Restore.
- C. Update the antivirus software definitions.
- D. Boot to safe mode.

Answer: A

Explanation: Quarantining the computer means isolating it from the network and other devices to prevent the spread of malware or ransomware. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the files on a computer and demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) to restore them. If a technician sees a file that is requesting payment to a cryptocurrency address, it is likely that the computer has been infected by ransomware. Quarantining the computer should be the first step to contain the infection and prevent further damage. Disabling System Restore, updating the antivirus software definitions, and booting to safe mode are not steps that should be done before quarantining the computer.

A user attempts to install additional software and receives a UAC prompt. Which of the following is the BEST way to resolve this issue?

- A. Add a user account to the local administrator's group.
- B. Configure Windows Defender Firewall to allow access to all networks.
- C. Create a Microsoft account.
- D. Disable the guest account.

Answer: A

Explanation: A user account that belongs to the local administrator’s group has the permission to install software on a Windows machine. If a user receives a UAC (user account control) prompt when trying to install software, it means the user does not have enough privileges and needs to enter an administrator’s password or switch to an administrator’s account. Adding the user account to the local administrator’s group can resolve this issue. Configuring Windows Defender Firewall, creating a Microsoft account and disabling the guest account are not related to this issue.

Certify For Sure with IT Exam Dumps

Explanation: The correct answer is A. Document the date and time of change. After implementing a change, the technician should document the date and time of change in the change log or record. This helps to track the change history, monitor the change performance, and identify any issues or incidents related to the change. Documenting the date and time of change is also a good practice for auditing and compliance purposes. Documenting the purpose of the change (B) and the risk level (C) are steps that should be done before implementing the change, not after. These are important information that help to justify, prioritize, and plan the change. The purpose of the change should explain why the change is needed and what benefits it will bring to the organization. The risk level should assess the potential impact and probability of the change causing any problems or disruptions to the business.

Documenting the findings of the sandbox test (D) is also a step that should be done before implementing the change, not after. A sandbox test is a way of testing the change in an isolated environment that mimics the production environment. This helps to verify that the change works as expected and does not cause any errors or conflicts with other systems or processes. The findings of the sandbox test should be documented and reviewed by the change advisory board (CAB) before approving the change for implementation.

During a recent flight an executive unexpectedly received several dog and cat pictures while trying to watch a movie via in-flight Wi-Fi on an iPhone. The executive has no records of any contacts sending pictures like these and has not seen these pictures before. To BEST resolve this issue, the executive should:

- A. set AirDrop so that transfers are only accepted from known contacts
- B. completely disable all wireless systems during the flight
- C. discontinue using iMessage and only use secure communication applications
- D. only allow messages and calls from saved contacts

Answer: A

Explanation: To best resolve this issue, the executive should set AirDrop so that transfers are only accepted from known contacts (option A).

# 467. Which of the following is an advantage of using WPA2 instead of WPA3?

- A. Connection security
- B. Encryption key length
- C. Device compatibility
- D. Offline decryption resistance

Answer: C

Explanation: Device compatibility is an advantage of using WPA2 instead of WPA3. WPA2 is the previous version of the Wi-Fi Protected Access protocol, which provides security and encryption for wireless networks. WPA3 is the latest version, which offers improved security features, such as stronger encryption, enhanced protection against brute-force attacks, and easier configuration. However, WPA3 is not backward compatible with older devices that only support WPA2 or earlier protocols. Therefore, using WPA3 may limit the range of devices that can connect to the wireless network. Connection security, encryption key length, and offline decryption resistance are advantages of using WPA3 instead of WPA2.

Certify For Sure with IT Exam Dumps

The first thing that a support technician should check to resolve the issue of not being able to receive emails or browse the internet from a smartphone while traveling is the data plan coverage. The data plan coverage determines how much data and where the user can use on the smartphone’s cellular network. The data plan coverage may vary depending on the user’s location, carrier and subscription. The data plan coverage may not include or support certain areas or countries that the user is traveling to, or may charge extra fees or limit the speed or amount of data that the user can use. The data plan coverage does not affect text messages and phone calls, which use different network services and protocols. User account status is not likely to cause the issue of not being able to receive emails or browse the internet from a smartphone while traveling, unless the user account has been suspended or terminated by the carrier or the email provider. Mobile OS version is not likely to cause the issue of not being able to receive emails or browse the internet from a smartphone while traveling, unless the mobile OS has a major bug or compatibility problem with the network or the email app. Network traffic outages may cause the issue of not being able to receive emails or browse the internet from a smartphone while traveling, but they are less likely and less common than data plan coverage issues, and they should also affect text messages and phone calls.

A company recently experienced a security incident in which a USB drive containing malicious software was able to covertly install malware on a workstation. Which of the following actions should be taken to prevent this incident from happening again? (Select two).

- A. Install a host-based IDS
- B. Restrict log-in times.
- C. Enable a BIOS password
- D. Update the password complexity
- E. Disable AutoRun.
- F. Update the antivirus definitions.
- G. Restrict user permissions.

Answer: E, F

Explanation: The correct answers are E and F. Disabling AutoRun and updating the antivirus definitions are two actions that should be taken to prevent the incident from happening again.

AutoRun is a feature of Windows that automatically executes a predetermined action when a removable media such as a USB drive is inserted in a computer. For example, AutoRun can launch or install a new program on the media, or open the file in File Explorer. However, this feature can also be exploited by malicious software that can run without the user’s consent or knowledge. Therefore, disabling AutoRun can help prevent accidental installation of viruses and other malware from USB drives.

Updating the antivirus definitions is another important action that can help prevent malware infections from USB drives. Antivirus definitions are files that contain information about the latest known threats and how to.

The No.1 IT Certification Dumps

# Certify For Sure with IT Exam Dumps

By updating the antivirus definitions regularly, you can ensure that your antivirus software can recognize and block any malicious software that may be on the USB drive before it can harm your computer45. A host-based IDS is a system that monitors and analyzes the activity on a single computer or device for any signs of intrusion or malicious behavior. A host-based IDS can help detect and prevent malware infections from USB drives, but it is not a sufficient action by itself. A host-based IDS needs to be complemented by other security measures, such as disabling AutoRun and updating the antivirus definitions6.

Restricting login times, enabling a BIOS password, and updating the password complexity are all actions that can help improve the security of a computer or device, but they are not directly related to preventing malware infections from USB drives. These actions can help prevent unauthorized access to the computer or device, but they do not affect how the computer or device interacts with the USB drive or its contents.

Restricting user permissions is an action that can help limit the damage that malware can cause on a computer or device, but it does not prevent the malware from being installed in the first place. Restricting user permissions means limiting what actions a user can perform on the computer or device, such as installing or deleting programs, modifying system settings, or accessing certain files or folders. By restricting user permissions, you can reduce the impact of malware infections by preventing them from affecting other users or system components7.

malware. Which of the following will MOST likely help to permanently remove the malware?

- A. Enabling System Restore
- B. Educating the user
- C. Booting into safe mode
- D. Scheduling a scan

Answer: B

# Explanation:

Although updating the anti-malware software and running scans are important steps in removing malware, they may not be sufficient to permanently remove the malware if the user keeps engaging in behaviors that leave the system vulnerable, such as downloading unknown files or visiting malicious websites. Therefore, educating the user on safe computing practices is the best way to prevent future infections and permanently remove the malware.

Enabling System Restore, Booting into safe mode, and scheduling a scan are not the most efficient ways to permanently remove the malware. Enabling System Restore and Booting into safe mode may help in some cases, but they may not be sufficient to permanently remove the malware. Scheduling a scan is also important for detecting and removing malware, but it may not be sufficient to prevent future infections.

A remote user's smartphone is performing very slowly. The user notices that the performance improves slightly after rebooting but then reverts back to performing slowly. The user also notices that the phone does not get any faster after connecting to the company's corporate guest network. A technician sees that the phone has a large number of applications installed on it. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the issue?

- A. The user is in a poor signal area.
- B. The user has too many processes running.
- C. The smartphone has malware on it.
- D. The smartphone has been jailbroken.

Answer: B

# Explanation:

One of the common reasons for a slow smartphone performance is having too many apps installed and running in the background. These apps consume the device’s memory (RAM) and CPU resources, which can affect the speed and responsiveness of the phone. Rebooting the phone can temporarily clear the RAM and stop some background processes, but they may resume after a while. Connecting to a different network does not affect the performance of the phone, unless the network is congested or has a poor signal.

The user can improve the phone’s performance by uninstalling unused apps, clearing app caches, and restricting background activities12. Malware can also slow down a phone, but it is not the most likely cause in this scenario, as the user does not report any other symptoms of infection, such as pop-ups, battery drain, or data usage spikes3. Jailbreaking a phone can also affect its performance, but

it is not a cause, rather a consequence, of the user’s actions. Jailbreaking is the process of removing the manufacturer’s restrictions on a phone, which allows the user to install unauthorized apps, customize the system, and access root privileges4. However, jailbreaking also exposes the phone to security risks, voids the warranty, and may cause instability or compatibility issues5.

# 498. A large organization is researching proprietary software with vendor support for a multiuser environment. Which of the following EULA types should be selected?

- A. Corporate
- B. Perpetual
- C. Open-source
- D. Personal

Answer: A

# Explanation:

A corporate EULA is a type of end-user license agreement that is designed for a large organization that needs to use proprietary software with vendor support for a multiuser environment. A corporate EULA typically grants the organization a volume license that allows it to install and use the software on multiple devices or servers, and to distribute the software to its employees or affiliates. A corporate EULA also usually provides the organization with technical support, maintenance, updates, and warranty from the software vendor, as well as some customization options and discounts. A corporate EULA may also include terms and conditions that specify the rights and obligations of both parties, such as confidentiality, liability, indemnification, termination, and dispute resolution12.

A corporate EULA is a better option than the other choices because:

- ✑ A perpetual EULA (B) is a type of end-user license agreement that grants the user a permanent and irrevocable license to use the software, without any time limit or expiration date. However, a perpetual EULA does not necessarily include vendor support, updates, or warranty, and it may not allow the user to install the software on multiple devices or servers, or to distribute the software to other users. A perpetual EULA may also be more expensive than a corporate EULA, as it requires a one-time payment upfront, rather than a recurring subscription fee34.

# Open-Source EULA

An open-source EULA is a type of end-user license agreement that grants the user a license to use, modify, and redistribute the software, which is publicly available and free of charge. However, an open-source EULA does not provide any vendor support, maintenance, updates, or warranty, and it may impose some restrictions or obligations on the user, such as disclosing the source code, attributing the original author, or using a compatible license for derivative works. An open-source EULA may not be suitable for a large organization that needs proprietary software with vendor support for a multiuser environment.

# Personal EULA

A personal EULA is a type of end-user license agreement that grants the user a license to use the software for personal, non-commercial purposes only. A personal EULA may limit the number of devices or servers that the user can install the software on, and prohibit the user from distributing, copying, or reselling the software to other users. A personal EULA may also provide limited or no vendor support, maintenance, updates, or warranty, and it may have a fixed or renewable term. A personal EULA may not meet the needs of a large organization that needs proprietary software with vendor support for a multiuser environment.

A technician needs to format a USB drive to transfer 20GB of data from a Linux computer to a Windows computer. Which of the following filesystems will the technician MOST likely use?

- A. FAT32
- B. ext4
- C. NTFS
- D. exFAT

Answer: C

Explanation: Since Windows systems support FAT32 and NTFS "out of the box" and Linux supports a whole range of them including FAT32 and NTFS, it is highly recommended to format the partition or disk you want to share in either FAT32 or NTFS, but since FAT32 has a file size limit of 4.2 GB, if you happen to work with huge files, then it is better you use NTFS.

# 503. Antivirus software indicates that a workstation is infected with ransomware that cannot be quarantined.

Which of the following should be performed FIRST to prevent further damage to the host and other systems?

- A. Power off the machine.
- B. Run a full antivirus scan.
- C. Remove the LAN card.
- D. Install a different endpoint solution.

Answer: A

Explanation: Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the files on a system and demands a ransom for their decryption. Ransomware can also spread to other systems on the network or exfiltrate sensitive data to the attackers. Therefore, it is important to isolate the infected machine as soon as possible to contain the infection and prevent further damage. Powering off the machine is a quick and effective way of disconnecting it from the network and stopping any malicious processes running on it. The other options are not directly related to preventing ransomware damage or may not be effective. Running a full antivirus scan may not be able to detect or remove the ransomware, especially if it is a new or unknown variant. Removing the LAN card may disconnect the machine from the network, but it may not stop any malicious processes running on it or any data encryption or exfiltration that has already occurred. Installing a different endpoint solution may not be possible or helpful if the system is already infected and locked by ransomware.

# 505. Which of the following items require special e-waste recycling? (Select two).

- A. Solid-state drive
- B. A/C adapter
- C. Surge protector
- D. Laptop battery
- E. CRT monitor
- F. Power supply

Answer: D, E

Explanation: Some electronic items require special e-waste recycling because they contain hazardous materials that can harm the environment and human health if disposed of improperly. Laptop batteries and CRT monitors are examples of such items.

Laptop batteries are usually made of lithium-ion or nickel-metal hydride, which are both toxic and flammable substances. If laptop batteries are thrown in the trash, they can leak, catch fire, or explode, causing pollution and injuries. Therefore, laptop batteries should be recycled at authorized collection centers or through manufacturer take-back programs.

CRT monitors are old types of display devices that use cathode ray tubes, which are glass tubes that emit electrons to create images on the screen. CRT monitors contain lead, mercury, cadmium, and phosphor, which are all harmful metals that can contaminate the soil, water, and air if dumped in landfills. Therefore, CRT monitors should be recycled at certified e-waste facilities or through retailer or manufacturer trade-in programs.

on a cellular connection. Which of the following is the best way to fix this issue?

1. A. Connect to the company's Wi-Fi network.
2. B. Change the settings on the phone to connect to a different cellular tower.
3. C. Install a cellular repeater at the office for this user.
4. D. Update all applications on the phone.

Answer: A

# Explanation:

The best way to fix the issue of slow cellular connection in the office is to connect to the company’s Wi-Fi network. This will allow the user’s mobile phone to access the internet through a faster and more reliable wireless network, instead of relying on the cellular network. Connecting to the Wi-Fi network will also save the user’s data usage and battery life.

Some of the factors that can affect the cellular connection speed are the distance from the cell tower, the obstructions between the phone and the tower, the network congestion, the network technology, and the features of the phone12. In the office, the user may experience a weak or unstable cellular signal due to the building structure, the location, or the interference from other devices. Therefore, switching to the Wi-Fi network can improve the performance of the phone’s applications and web browsing.

A kiosk, which is running Microsoft Windows 10, relies exclusively on a numeric keypad to allow customers to enter their ticket numbers but no other information. If the kiosk is idle for four hours, the login screen locks. Which of the following sign-on options would allow any employee the ability to unlock the kiosk?

- A. Requiring employees to enter their usernames and passwords
- B. Setting up facial recognition for each employee
- C. Using a PIN and providing it to employees
- D. Requiring employees to use their fingerprints

Answer: C

# Explanation:

The best sign-on option that would allow any employee the ability to unlock the kiosk that relies exclusively on a numeric keypad is to use a PIN and provide it to employees. A PIN is a Personal Identification Number that is a numeric code that can be used as part of authentication or access control. A PIN can be entered using only a numeric keypad and can be easily shared with employees who need to unlock the kiosk. Requiring employees to enter their usernames and passwords may not be feasible or convenient if the kiosk only has a numeric keypad and no other input devices. Setting up facial recognition for each employee may not be possible or secure if the kiosk does not have a camera or biometric sensor. Requiring employees to use their fingerprints may not be possible or secure if the kiosk does not have a fingerprint scanner or biometric sensor.

- D. Log-on times

Answer: A

Explanation: Date and time is the most likely cause of the issue. The date and time settings on a workstation affect the validity of the certificates used by websites to establish secure connections. If the date and time are incorrect, the workstation may not recognize the certificate as valid and display an invalid certificate error. Other workstations on the same local network may not have this issue if their date and time are correct.

User access control, UEFI boot mode, and log-on times are not likely causes of the issue. User access control is a feature that prevents unauthorized changes to the system by prompting for confirmation or credentials. UEFI boot mode is a firmware interface that controls the boot process of the workstation. Log-on times are settings that restrict when a user can log in to the workstation. None of these factors affect the validity of the certificates used by websites.

home routers being targeted by malicious actors and then used in DDoS attacks. Which of the following can the technician MOST likely do to defend against this threat?

- A. Add network content filtering.
- B. Disable the SSID broadcast.
- C. Configure port forwarding.
- D. Change the default credentials.

Answer: D

# Explanation:

One of the most effective ways to defend against malicious actors targeting home routers for DDoS attacks is to change the default credentials of the router. The default credentials are often well-known or easily guessed by attackers, who can then access and compromise the router settings and firmware. By changing the default credentials to strong and unique ones, a technician can prevent unauthorized access and configuration changes to the router. Adding network content filtering may help block some malicious or unwanted websites but may not prevent attackers from exploiting router vulnerabilities or backdoors. Disabling the SSID broadcast may help reduce the visibility of the wireless network but may not prevent attackers from scanning or detecting it. Configuring port forwarding may help direct incoming traffic to specific devices or services but may not prevent attackers from sending malicious packets or requests to the router.
