    "question": "A Windows user recently replaced a computer. The user can access the public internet on the computer; however, an internal site at https://companyintranet.com:8888 is no longer loading. Which of the following should a technician adjust to resolve the issue?",
    "options": [
      "A. Default gateway settings",
      "B. DHCP settings",

    "question": "The firewall settings control how the firewall filters and allows network traffic based on rules and policies. The firewall settings may be blocking or preventing the access to the internal site by mistake or by default, especially if the site uses a non-standard port number such as 8888. The technician should check and modify the firewall settings to allow the access to the internal site or its port number. Default gateway settings determine how a computer connects to other networks or the internet. Default gateway settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access the public internet. DHCP settings determine how a computer obtains its IP address and other network configuration parameters automatically from a DHCP server. DHCP settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access other network resources. IP address settings determine how a computer identifies itself and communicates with other devices on a network. IP address settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access other network resources. Antivirus settings control how the antivirus software scans and protects the computer from malware and threats. Antivirus settings are less likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site than firewall settings, unless the antivirus software has its own firewall feature that may interfere with the network traffic.

    "question": "SMB is a network file sharing protocol that enables access to files, printers, and other resources on a network. Port 445 is used by SMB to communicate directly over TCP without the need for NetBIOS, which is an older and less secure protocol. The security log shows that the source IP address 192.168.1.1 sent a file named secrets.zip using SMB protocol to the destination IP address 192.168.1.50, which captured the file. The Windows firewall information shows that port 445 is enabled for inbound and outbound traffic, which means that it is not blocked by the firewall. Therefore, port 445 is the most likely port that was exploited by the attacker to steal the data from the corporate laptop. The company plans to upgrade from a 32-bit Windows OS to a 64-bit OS.

A browser hijacker can also steal the user’s personal data, display unwanted ads, and install more malware on the device. To remove a browser hijacker, the user should first uninstall the browser from the Control Panel, then scan the device with an antivirus or anti-malware program, and finally install a trusted browser."

    "explanation": "Incremental backup is a backup method that only backs up the files that have changed since the last backup, whether it was a full or an incremental backup. Incremental backup can save storage space and bandwidth, as it does not copy the same files over and over again. Incremental backup can also retain more versions of backups, as it only stores the changes made to the files. However, incremental backup can have longer restore times, as it requires restoring the last full backup and all the subsequent incremental backups in order to recover the data. The law firm is not concerned about restore times but asks the technician to retain more versions when possible, so incremental backup would be a suitable choice for them."

    "question": "This way, if a disaster such as a hurricane or a power outage affects one location, the backups in another location will still be available and accessible2. Regionally diverse backups can help ensure business continuity and data recovery in case of a disaster3. The other options are not the best backup solutions for a site in an area that has frequent hurricanes and an unstable power grid. High availability is a feature that allows a system to remain operational and accessible even if one or more components fail, but it does not protect against data loss or corruption4. On-site backups are backups that are stored in the same location as the primary site, which means they are vulnerable to the same disasters that can affect the primary site. Incremental backups are backups that only store the changes made since the last backup, which means they require less storage space and bandwidth, but they also depend on previous backups to restore data and may not be sufficient for disaster recovery.A user reports that the pages flash on the screen two or three times before finally staying open when attempting to access banking web pages.

    "explanation": "The next troubleshooting step that the technician should perform to resolve the issue of pages flashing on the screen before staying open when accessing banking web pages is to verify the address bar URL. The address bar URL is the web address that appears in the browser’s address bar and indicates the location of the web page being accessed. Verifying the address bar URL can help determine if the user is accessing a legitimate or malicious website, as some phishing websites may try to impersonate banking websites by using similar-looking URLs or domains."

A remote wipe is a feature that allows an administrator or a user to erase all the data and settings on a device remotely, usually through a web portal or an email command. A remote wipe can help prevent the data from being accessed or compromised by anyone who finds or steals the device. Changing the office’s Wi-Fi SSID and password may prevent the device from connecting to the office network but may not prevent the data from being accessed locally or through other networks. Changing the user’s password may prevent the device from logging in to the user’s account but may not prevent the data from being accessed by other means or accounts.
