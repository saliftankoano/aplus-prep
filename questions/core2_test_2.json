    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Rebooting the smartphone is the first and simplest step to resolve the issue of frequent crashes and unresponsiveness. Rebooting clears the memory, closes the background apps, and refreshes the system. It can also fix minor glitches and bugs that may cause the calendar app or the smartphone to malfunction. The other options are either too drastic or unnecessary. Reinstalling the application may not solve the problem if the issue is with the smartphone itself. Updating the smartphone’s OS may not be possible or helpful if the device is unresponsive or incompatible. Resetting the smartphone to factory settings will erase all the data and settings on the device, which should be the last resort. A department manager submits a help desk ticket to request the migration of a printer's port utilization from USB to Ethernet so multiple users can access the printer. This will be a new network printer; thus a new IP address allocation is required. Which of the following should happen immediately before network use is authorized? - A. Document the date and time of the change. - B. Submit a change request form. - C. Determine the risk level of this change. - D. Request an unused IP address. Answer: D Explanation: An IP address is a unique identifier that allows a device to communicate with other devices on a network. A network printer needs an IP address to be accessible by multiple users on the network. Requesting an unused IP address from the network administrator or using an IP address scanner is the first step in this process. Step that should happen immediately before network use is authorized, as it ensures that there is no IP address conflict or duplication on the network. Documenting the date and time of the change, submitting a change request form, and determining the risk level of this change are steps that should happen before requesting an unused IP address. A workstation is displaying a message indicating that a user must exchange cryptocurrency for a decryption key. Which of the following is the best way for a technician to return the device to service safely? - A. Run an AV scan. - B. Reinstall the operating system - C. Install a software firewall. - D. Perform a system restore. - E. Comply with the on-screen instructions. Answer: B Explanation: The best way for a technician to return the device to service safely is to reinstall the operating system. This is because the device is infected by ransomware, which is a form of malware that encrypts files and demands payment for decryption. Reinstalling the operating system will erase the ransomware and restore the device to its original state. However, this will also delete any data that was not backed up before the infection. Therefore, it is important to have regular backups of critical data and protect them from ransomware attacks1. The other options are not effective or safe for ransomware recovery. Running an AV scan may not detect or remove the ransomware, especially if it is a new or unknown variant. Installing a software firewall may prevent future attacks, but it will not help with the current infection. Performing a system restore may not work if the ransomware has corrupted or deleted the restore points. Complying with the on-screen instructions is not advisable, as it will encourage the attackers and there is no guarantee that they will provide the decryption key after receiving the payment. To prevent and recover from ransomware attacks, it is recommended to follow some best practices, such as234: - Use strong passwords and multifactor authentication for all accounts and devices. - Keep all software and firmware updated with the latest security patches. - Avoid opening suspicious or unsolicited emails and attachments. ✑ Educate users and staff on how to recognize and report phishing and social engineering attempts. ✑ Use antivirus software and enable real-time protection. ✑ Enable network segmentation and firewall rules to limit the spread of ransomware. ✑ Implement a Zero Trust security model to verify all requests and devices before granting access. ✑ Create and test backups of critical data and store them offline or in a separate network. ✑ Recover safely by isolating the infected devices, identifying the ransomware variant, and restoring data from backups. ✑ Report any ransomware incidents to law enforcement agencies and seek help from experts. A user opened a ticket regarding a corporate-managed mobile device. The assigned technician notices the OS is several versions out of date. The user is unaware the OS version is not current because auto-update is turned on. Which of the following is MOST likely the cause of the issue? - A. The device does not have enough free space to download the OS updates. - B. The device needs domain administrator confirmation to update to a major release. - C. The device is not compatible with the newest version of the OS. - D. The device is restricted from updating due to a corporate security policy. Answer: D Explanation: A corporate security policy can restrict a corporate-managed mobile device from updating its OS automatically, even if the auto-update feature is turned on. This can be done to prevent compatibility issues, security risks or performance problems caused by untested or unwanted updates. The device administrator can control when and how the updates are applied to the device. The device not having enough free space, needing domain administrator confirmation or being incompatible with the newest version of the OS are not likely causes of the issue, since the user would receive an error message or a notification in those cases. Verified References: https://www.comptia.org/blog/mobile-device-management https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a A user's iPhone was permanently locked after several failed log-in attempts. Which of the following authentication methods are needed to restore access, applications, and data to the device? - A. Fingerprint and pattern - B. Facial recognition and PIN code Answer: D Explanation: If a user’s iPhone is permanently locked after several failed log-in attempts, the user will need to use the recovery contact and recovery key to restore access, applications, and data to the device. The recovery contact is a trusted person who can receive a verification code from Apple and share it with the user. The recovery key is a 28-character code that the user created when setting up two-factor authentication for their Apple ID. The user will need to enter both the verification code and the recovery key on another device or computer to unlock their iPhone. This method will erase the iPhone and restore it from the iCloud backup. A technician is upgrading the backup system for documents at a high-volume law firm. The current backup system can retain no more than three versions of full backups before failing. The law firm is not concerned about restore times but asks the technician to retain more versions when possible. Which of the following backup methods should the technician MOST likely implement? - A. Full - B. Mirror - C. Incremental - D. Differential Answer: C Explanation: The law firm wants to retain more versions of the backups when possible, so the best backup method for the technician to implement in this scenario would be Incremental backup. Incremental backups only save the changes made since the last backup, which allows for more frequent backups and minimizes the amount of storage required. This would allow the law firm to retain more than three versions of backups without risking backup failure. To retain more versions of backups, the technician should implement an Incremental backup method. An incremental backup method only backs up the data that has changed since the last backup, so it requires less storage space than a full backup."

Which of the following can the administrator do to best solve the user's issue? - A. Turn on airplane mode. - B. Set the connection to be metered. - C. Configure the device to use a static IP address. - D. Enable the Windows Defender Firewall. Answer: B Setting the connection to be metered is the best solution for limiting the amount of cellular data a user’s Windows 10 tablet can utilize when traveling. A metered connection is a network connection that has a data limit or charges fees based on the amount of data used. Windows 10 allows users to set any network connection as metered, which reduces the amount of data that Windows and some apps use in the background. For example, setting a connection as metered will prevent Windows from downloading updates automatically, stop some apps from syncing data online, and disable some live tiles on the Start menu. Setting a connection as metered can help users save cellular data and avoid extra charges when traveling. Turning on airplane mode, configuring the device to use a static IP address, and enabling the Windows Defender Firewall are not effective solutions for limiting the amount of cellular data a user’s Windows 10 tablet can utilize when traveling. Turning on airplane mode will disable all wireless connections on the device, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular data. This will prevent the user from accessing any online services or applications on the tablet. Configuring the device to use a static IP address will assign a fixed IP address to the device instead of obtaining one dynamically from a DHCP server. This will not affect the amount of cellular data the device uses, and it may cause IP conflicts or connectivity issues on some networks. Enabling the Windows Defender Firewall will block or allow incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined or custom rules. This will not reduce the amount of cellular data the device uses, and it may interfere with some apps or services that require network access. - ✑ Official CompTIA learning resources CompTIA A+ Core 1 and Core 2, page 19 - ✑ CompTIA A+ Complete Study Guide: Core 1 Exam 220-1101 and Core 2 Exam …, page 108 A department manager submits a help desk ticket to request the migration of a printer's port utilization from USB to Ethernet so multiple users can access the printer.

The system is missing updates. - B. The system is utilizing a 32-bit OS. - C. The system's memory is failing. D. The system requires BIOS updates Answer: B Explanation: The most likely reason that the system is not utilizing all the available RAM is that the system is utilizing a 32-bit OS. A 32-bit OS is an operating system that uses 32 bits to address memory locations and perform calculations. A 32-bit OS can only support up to 4GB of RAM, and some of that RAM may be reserved for hardware devices or system functions, leaving less than 4GB of usable RAM for applications and processes. A 32-bit OS cannot recognize or utilize more than 4GB of RAM, even if more RAM is installed on the system. To utilize all the available RAM, the system needs to use a 64-bit OS, which can support much more RAM than a 32-bit OS. The system missing updates may cause some performance or compatibility issues, but it does not affect the amount of usable RAM on the system. The system’s memory failing may cause some errors or crashes, but it does not affect the amount of usable RAM on the system. The system requiring BIOS updates may cause some configuration or compatibility issues, but it does not affect the amount of usable RAM on the system."

    "question": "Click on Choose what closing the lid does on the left side. Under When I close the lid, select Do nothing for both On battery and Plugged in. Click on Save changes. This will prevent the laptop from going to sleep when you close the lid while it is connected to the docking station and the external monitor. Hibernate, sleep/suspend, and turn on fast startup are not the options that should be configured to fix the issue. Hibernate and sleep/suspend are both power-saving modes that allow you to resume your work without losing any data. However, they also turn off the display and other components of the laptop, which means you will not be able to use the external monitor when the laptop is closed. Turn on fast startup is a feature that reduces the boot time of Windows by saving some system information to a file when you shut down. It does not affect how the laptop behaves when you close the lid. A suite of security applications was installed a few days ago on a user's home computer.

Ask the user to click in the Search field, type Check for Updates, and then press the Enter key - D. Advise the user to wait for an upcoming, automatic patch Answer: C Explanation: The technician should guide the user to update Windows through the built-in \"Check for Updates\" feature. This can be done by having the user click in the Search field, type \"Check for Updates\", and then press the Enter key. This will bring up the Windows Update function, which will search for any available updates and give the user the option to install them. A laptop user is visually impaired and requires a different cursor color. Which of the following OS utilities is used to change the color of the cursor? - A. Keyboard Mobile device multifactor authentication (MFA) is a method of verifying a user’s identity by requiring two or more factors, such as something the user knows (e.g., password, PIN, security question), something the user has (e.g., smartphone, OTP app, security key), or something the user is (e.g., fingerprint, face, iris). The combination of fingerprint and password meets the requirements for mobile device MFA because it uses two different factors: something the user is (fingerprint) and something the user knows (password). The other combinations do not meet the requirements because they use only one factor: something the user knows (password or PIN) or something the user does (swipe)."

    "question": "A developer reports that a workstation's database file extensions have been changed from .db to .enc. The developer is also unable to open the database files manually. Which of the following is the best option for recovering the data?",
    "options": [
      "A. Accessing a restore point",
      "B. Rebooting into safe mode",
      "C. Utilizing the backups",
      "D. Using an AV to scan the affected files"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The scenario described in the question suggests that the workstation has been infected by a ransomware, which is a type of malware that encrypts the files on the target system and demands a ransom for the decryption key12. The file extension .enc is commonly used by some ransomware variants to mark the encrypted files34. The developer is unable to open the database files manually because they are encrypted and require the decryption key, which is usually held by the attacker. The best option for recovering the data is to utilize the backups, assuming that the backups are recent, valid, and not affected by the ransomware. Backups are copies of the data that are stored in a separate location or device, and can be used to restore the data in case of a disaster, such as a ransomware attack. By restoring the data from the backups, the developer can avoid paying the ransom and losing the data permanently. Accessing a restore point is not a good option, because restore points are snapshots of the system settings and configuration, not the data files. Restore points can help to undo some system changes, such as installing a faulty driver or software, but they cannot recover the encrypted data files. Rebooting into safe mode is also not a good option, because safe mode is a diagnostic mode that allows the system to run with minimal drivers and services, but it does not affect the data files. Safe mode can help to troubleshoot some system issues, such as malware infections, but it cannot decrypt the data files. Using an AV to scan the affected files is also not a good option, because an AV is a software that can detect and remove some malware, but it cannot decrypt the data files. An AV can help to prevent or remove some ransomware infections, but it cannot recover the encrypted data files."

Which of the following provide the BEST way to secure physical access to a data center server room? (Select TWO). - A. Biometric lock - B. Badge reader C. USB token D. Video surveillance E. Locking rack F. Access control vestibule Answer: A,B Explanation: A biometric lock requires an authorized user to provide a unique biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint, in order to gain access to the server room. A badge reader requires an authorized user to swipe an access card in order to gain access. Both of these methods ensure that only authorized personnel are able to access the server room. Additionally, video surveillance and access control vestibules can be used to further secure the server room. Finally, a locking rack can be used to physically secure the servers, so that they cannot be accessed without the appropriate key. A technician is selling up a newly built computer. Which of the following is the FASTEST way for the technician to install Windows 10? A. Factory reset B. System Restore C. In-place upgrade D. Unattended installation Answer: D Explanation: An unattended installation is the fastest way to install Windows 10 on a newly built computer. It uses an answer file that contains all the configuration settings and preferences for the installation, such as language, product key, partition size, etc. It does not require any user interaction or input during the installation process. Factory reset, System Restore and in-place upgrade are not methods of installing Windows 10 on a new computer, but ways of restoring or updating an existing Windows installation.

The five primary partitions should contain 4TB of free space. Which of the following partition styles should the technician use to partition the device? A. EFS A. GPT B. MBR C. FAT32 Answer: B GPT is the correct answer for this question. GPT stands for GUID Partition Table, and it is a partition style that supports up to 128 primary partitions and up to 18 exabytes of disk size per partition. GPT also uses a unique identifier for each partition and provides better data protection and recovery. GPT is suitable for partitioning a hard disk that has five primary partitions with 4TB of free space each. EFS, MBR, and FAT32 are not correct answers for this question. EFS stands for Encrypting File System, and it is a feature that allows encrypting files and folders on NTFS volumes. EFS is not a partition style, but rather a file system attribute. MBR stands for Master Boot Record, and it is an older partition style that supports up to four primary partitions and up to 2TB of disk size per partition. MBR cannot handle five primary partitions with 4TB of free space each. FAT32 stands for File Allocation Table 32, and it is a file system that supports up to 32GB of disk size per partition and up to 4GB of file size. FAT32 is not a partition style, but rather a file system type. - Official CompTIA learning resources CompTIA A+ Core 1 and Core 2, page 14 - CompTIA A+ Complete Study Guide: Core 1 Exam 220-1101 and Core 2 Exam …, page 105"
