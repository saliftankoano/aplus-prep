    "question": "A macOS user is installing a new application. Which of the following system directories is the software MOST likely to install by default?",
    "options": [
      "A. /etc/services",
      "B. /Applications",
      "C. /usr/bin",
      "D. C:\\Program Files"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The software is most likely to install by default in the /Applications directory, which is the standard location for macOS applications. This directory can be accessed from the Finder sidebar or by choosing Go > Applications from the menu bar. The /Applications directory contains all the applications that are available to all users on the system. Some applications might also offer the option to install in the ~/Applications directory, which is a personal applications folder for a single user. The /etc/services directory is a system configuration file that maps service names to port numbers and protocols3. The /usr/bin directory is a system directory that contains executable binaries for various commands and utilities4. The C:\\Program Files directory is a Windows directory that does not exist on macOS. A payroll workstation has data on it that needs to be readily available and can be recovered quickly if something is accidentally removed. Which of the following backup methods should be used to provide fast data recovery in this situation? <table> <tbody><tr> <td>A.</td> <td>Full</td> </tr> <tr> <td>B.</td> <td>Differential</td> </tr> <tr> <td>C.</td> <td>Synthetic</td> </tr> <tr> <td>D.</td> <td>Incremental</td> </tr> </tbody></table> Answer: A Explanation: A full backup does not depend on any previous backups, unlike differential or incremental backups, which only save the changes made since the last backup. A synthetic backup is a type of full backup that combines an existing full backup with incremental backups to create a new full backup, but it still requires multiple backup sets to recover data. Therefore, a full backup is the most suitable for the payroll workstation that needs to have its data readily available and recoverable. You can learn more about the differences between full, differential, incremental, and synthetic backups from this article. A user's iPhone was permanently locked after several failed login attempts. Which of the following will restore access to the device? <table> <tbody><tr> <td>A.</td> <td>Fingerprint and pattern</td> </tr> <tr> <td>B.</td> <td>Facial recognition and PIN code</td> </tr> <tr> <td>C.</td> <td>Primary account and password</td> </tr> <tr> <td>D.</td> <td>Secondary account and recovery code</td> </tr> </tbody></table> Answer: D Explanation: A secondary account and recovery code are used to reset the primary account and password on an iPhone after it has been locked due to failed login attempts. Fingerprint, pattern, facial recognition and PIN code are biometric or numeric methods that can be used to unlock an iPhone, but they are not helpful if the device has been permanently locked.

After a Windows update, the user can no longer use certain locally attached devices, and a reboot has not fixed the issue. Which of the following should the technician perform to fix the issue? - A. Disable the Windows Update service. - B. Check for updates. - C. Restore hidden updates. - D. Rollback updates. Answer: D The technician should perform a rollback of the Windows update that caused the issue with the locally attached devices. A rollback is a process of uninstalling an update and restoring the previous version of the system. This can help to fix any compatibility or performance issues caused by the update1. To rollback an update, the technician can use the Settings app, the Control Panel, or the System Restore feature. The technician should also check for any device driver updates that might be needed after rolling back the update. Disabling the Windows Update service is not a good practice, as it can prevent the system from receiving important security and feature updates. Checking for updates might not fix the issue, as the update that caused the issue might still be installed. Restoring hidden updates is not relevant, as it only applies to updates that have been hidden by the user to prevent them from being installed2. - 1: https://www.windowscentral.com/how-uninstall-and-reinstall-updates-windows-10 - 2: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-or-hide-updates-in-windows-10-9c9f0a4f-9a6e-4c8e-8b44-afbc6b33f3cf When a user calls in to report an issue, a technician submits a ticket on the user's behalf. Which of the following practices should the technician use to make sure the ticket is associated with the correct user? - A. Have the user provide a callback phone number to be added to the ticket - B. Assign the ticket to the department's power user - C. Register the ticket with a unique user identifier D. Provide the user with a unique ticket number that can be referenced on subsequent calls. Answer: D Explanation: The technician should provide the user with a unique ticket number that can be referenced on subsequent calls to make sure the ticket is associated with the correct user. This is because registering the ticket with a unique user identifier, having the user provide a callback phone number to be added to the ticket, or assigning the ticket to the department’s power user will not ensure that the ticket is associated with the correct user2. - A. Fingerprint scan and retina scan - B. Password and PIN - C. Username and password - D. Smart card and password Answer: D Explanation: Smart card and password is an example of two-factor authentication (2FA), not multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA requires two or more authentication factors. Smart card and password is an example of two-factor authentication (2FA2). - A. Printing Preferences/Advanced tab - B. Printer Properties/Sharing tab - C. Printer Properties/Security tab - D. Printer Properties/Ports tab Answer: B Explanation: The correct answer is B. Printer Properties/Sharing tab. This is the location where the technician can enable printer sharing and assign a share name for the USB printer. This will allow other computers on the network to access the printer by using the share name or the IP address of the computer that has the printer attached1."

    "options": [
      "A. Assigning share permissions",
      "B. Enabling inheritance",
      "C. Requiring multifactor authentication",
      "D. Removing archive attribute"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Enabling inheritance is a method that allows new subfolders to inherit the permissions and settings from their parent folder. If users can access files in the department share, but not in the new subfolders created by other users, it may indicate that inheritance is disabled and that each new subfolder has its own permissions and settings that restrict access to only the creator. Enabling inheritance can help resolve this issue by allowing all users to access the new subfolders with the same permissions and settings as the department share. Assigning share permissions, requiring multifactor authentication, and removing archive attribute are not methods that can most likely allow all users to access the new folders."

The technician needs to secure the vendor's sensitive data. Which of the following should the specialist do FIRST to protect the company's data?",
    "options": [
      "A. Manually configure an IP address, a subnet mask, and a default gateway.",
      "B. Connect to the vendor's network using a VPN.",
      "C. Change the network location to private.",
      "D. Configure MFA on the network."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The first thing that the specialist should do to protect the company’s data on an insecure network with open authentication is to connect to the vendor’s network using a VPN. A VPN stands for Virtual Private Network and is a technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection over a public or untrusted network. A VPN can protect the company’s data by preventing eavesdropping, interception or modification of the network traffic by unauthorized parties. A VPN can also provide access to the company’s internal network and resources remotely. Manually configuring an IP address, a subnet mask and a default gateway may not be necessary or possible if the vendor’s network uses DHCP to assign network configuration parameters automatically. Manually configuring an IP address, a subnet mask and a default gateway does not protect the company’s data from network attacks or threats. Changing the network location to private may not be advisable or effective if the vendor’s network is a public or untrusted network. Changing the network location to private does not protect the company’s data from network attacks or threats. Configuring MFA on the network may not be feasible or sufficient if the vendor’s network has open authentication and does not support or require MFA. Configuring MFA on the network does not protect the company’s data from network attacks or threats.

      "B. Document the purpose of the change.",
      "C. Document the risk level.",
      "D. Document the findings of the sandbox test."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Document the date and time of change. After implementing a change, the technician should document the date and time of change in the change log or record. This helps to track the change history, monitor the change performance, and identify any issues or incidents related to the change. Documenting the date and time of change is also a good practice for auditing and compliance purposes. Documenting the purpose of the change (B) and the risk level (C) are steps that should be done before implementing the change, not after. These are important information that help to justify, prioritize, and plan the change. The purpose of the change should explain why the change is needed and what benefits it will bring to the organization. The risk level should assess the potential impact and probability of the change causing any problems or disruptions to the business. Documenting the findings of the sandbox test (D) is also a step that should be done before implementing the change, not after. A sandbox test is a way of testing the change in an isolated environment that mimics the production environment. This helps to verify that the change works as expected and does not cause any errors or conflicts with other systems or processes. The findings of the sandbox test should be documented and reviewed by the change advisory board (CAB) before approving the change for implementation. - What is a Change Advisory Board?

Which of the following will MOST likely help to permanently remove the malware? - A. Enabling System Restore - B. Educating the user - C. Booting into safe mode - D. Scheduling a scan Answer: B Although updating the anti-malware software and running scans are important steps in removing malware, they may not be sufficient to permanently remove the malware if the user keeps engaging in behaviors that leave the system vulnerable, such as downloading unknown files or visiting malicious websites. Therefore, educating the user on safe computing practices is the best way to prevent future infections and permanently remove the malware. Enabling System Restore, Booting into safe mode, and scheduling a scan are not the most efficient ways to permanently remove the malware. Enabling System Restore and Booting into safe mode may help in some cases, but they may not be sufficient to permanently remove the malware. Scheduling a scan is also important for detecting and removing malware, but it may not be sufficient to prevent future infections. https://partners.comptia.org/docs/default-source/resources/comptia-a-220-1102-exam-objectives-(3-0)"

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "One of the common reasons for a slow smartphone performance is having too many apps installed and running in the background. These apps consume the device’s memory (RAM) and CPU resources, which can affect the speed and responsiveness of the phone. Rebooting the phone can temporarily clear the RAM and stop some background processes, but they may resume after a while. Connecting to a different network does not affect the performance of the phone, unless the network is congested or has a poor signal. The user can improve the phone’s performance by uninstalling unused apps, clearing app caches, and restricting background activities12. Malware can also slow down a phone, but it is not the most likely cause in this scenario, as the user does not report any other symptoms of infection, such as pop-ups, battery drain, or data usage spikes3. Jailbreaking a phone can also affect its performance, but it is not a cause, rather a consequence, of the user’s actions. Jailbreaking is the process of removing the manufacturer’s restrictions on a phone, which allows the user to install unauthorized apps, customize the system, and access root privileges4. However, jailbreaking also exposes the phone to security risks, voids the warranty, and may cause instability or compatibility issues5. - A. Corporate - B. Perpetual - C. Open-source - D. Personal Answer: A A corporate EULA is a type of end-user license agreement that is designed for a large organization that needs to use proprietary software with vendor support for a multiuser environment. A corporate EULA typically grants the organization a volume license that allows it to install and use the software on multiple devices or servers, and to distribute the software to its employees or affiliates. A corporate EULA also usually provides the organization with technical support, maintenance, updates, and warranty from the software vendor, as well as some customization options and discounts. A corporate EULA may also include terms and conditions that specify the rights and obligations of both parties, such as confidentiality, liability, indemnification, termination, and dispute resolution12. A corporate EULA is a better option than the other choices because: - ✑ A perpetual EULA (B) is a type of end-user license agreement that grants the user a permanent and irrevocable license to use the software, without any time limit or expiration date. However, a perpetual EULA does not necessarily include vendor support, updates, or warranty, and it may not allow the user to install the software on multiple devices or servers, or to distribute the software to other users. A perpetual EULA may also be more expensive than a corporate EULA, as it requires a one-time payment upfront, rather than a recurring subscription fee34. An open-source EULA is a type of end-user license agreement that grants the user a license to use, modify, and redistribute the software, which is publicly available and free of charge. However, an open-source EULA does not provide any vendor support, maintenance, updates, or warranty, and it may impose some restrictions or obligations on the user, such as disclosing the source code, attributing the original author, or using a compatible license for derivative works. An open-source EULA may not be suitable for a large organization that needs proprietary software with vendor support for a multiuser environment. A personal EULA is a type of end-user license agreement that grants the user a license to use the software for personal, non-commercial purposes only. A personal EULA may limit the number of devices or servers that the user can install the software on, and prohibit the user from distributing, copying, or reselling the software to other users. A personal EULA may also provide limited or no vendor support, maintenance, updates, or warranty, and it may have a fixed or renewable term. A personal EULA may not meet the needs of a large organization that needs proprietary software with vendor support for a multiuser environment."
