      "B. Screen zoom",
      "C. Screen timeout",
      "D. Screen brightness"

    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Screen timeout is the setting that determines how long the screen stays on after the user stops interacting with the phone. Screen brightness is the setting that determines how much light the screen emits. Both of these settings affect the battery life of the phone, as keeping the screen on longer and brighter consumes more power than turning it off sooner and dimmer. A technician should check these settings first to troubleshoot the issue of low battery life and adjust them accordingly. Screen resolution, screen zoom, screen damage, and screen motion smoothness are not settings that directly affect the battery life or the screen staying on for a long time."

SFC is a command-line utility that scans for and repairs corrupted system files. It can be run from the command prompt or from the Windows Recovery Environment. Rebuilding the Windows profiles, restoring the computers from backup, and reimaging the computers are more drastic measures that should be taken only if SFC fails to correct the issue."

      "B. Graphics card",
      "C. Random-access memory",
      "D. Monitor"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "A graphics card, also known as a video card or a GPU (graphics processing unit), is a component that can affect the performance of a computer game. A graphics card is responsible for rendering and displaying graphics on the screen, such as images, animations, and effects. A computer game may require a high level of graphics processing power to run smoothly and achieve high frame rates, which are the number of frames per second (FPS) that the game can display. Upgrading to a better graphics card can improve the performance of a computer game by increasing its graphics quality and frame rates.

      "B. Cryptominer",
      "C. Ransomware",

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The type of malware that is most likely to blame for a PC running more slowly than usual and having an extremely high GPU temperature is a “cryptominer”. Cryptominers are a type of malware that use the resources of a computer to mine cryptocurrency. This can cause the computer to run more slowly than usual and can cause the GPU temperature to rise. Spyware is a type of malware that is used to spy on a user’s activities, but it does not typically cause high GPU temperatures. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a user’s files and demands payment to unlock them, but it does not typically cause high GPU temperatures.

This will prevent the laptop from going to sleep when you close the lid while it is connected to the docking station and the external monitor. Hibernate, sleep/suspend, and turn on fast startup are not the options that should be configured to fix the issue. Hibernate and sleep/suspend are both power-saving modes that allow you to resume your work without losing any data. However, they also turn off the display and other components of the laptop, which means you will not be able to use the external monitor when the laptop is closed.
