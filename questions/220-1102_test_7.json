    "question": "The other options are not effective or safe for ransomware recovery. Running an AV scan may not detect or remove the ransomware, especially if it is a new or unknown variant. Installing a software firewall may prevent future attacks, but it will not help with the current infection. Performing a system restore may not work if the ransomware has corrupted or deleted the restore points. Complying with the on-screen instructions is not advisable, as it will encourage the attackers and there is no guarantee that they will provide the decryption key after receiving the payment. To prevent and recover from ransomware attacks, it is recommended to follow some best practices, such as234: - Use strong passwords and multifactor authentication for all accounts and devices. - Keep all software and firmware updated with the latest security patches. - Avoid opening suspicious or unsolicited emails and attachments.✑ Educate users and staff on how to recognize and report phishing and social engineering attempts. ✑ Use antivirus software and enable real-time protection. ✑ Enable network segmentation and firewall rules to limit the spread of ransomware. ✑ Implement a Zero Trust security model to verify all requests and devices before granting access. ✑ Create and test backups of critical data and store them offline or in a separate network. ✑ Recover safely by isolating the infected devices, identifying the ransomware variant, and restoring data from backups. ✑ Report any ransomware incidents to law enforcement agencies and seek help from experts.A user opened a ticket regarding a corporate-managed mobile device. The assigned technician notices the OS is several versions out of date. The user is unaware the OS version is not current because auto-update is turned on. Which of the following is MOST likely the cause of the issue?",
    "options": [
      "A. The device does not have enough free space to download the OS updates.",
      "B. The device needs domain administrator confirmation to update to a major release.",
      "C. The device is not compatible with the newest version of the OS.",
      "D. The device is restricted from updating due to a corporate security policy."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "A corporate security policy can restrict a corporate-managed mobile device from updating its OS automatically, even if the auto-update feature is turned on. This can be done to prevent compatibility issues, security risks or performance problems caused by untested or unwanted updates. The device administrator can control when and how the updates are applied to the device. The device not having enough free space, needing domain administrator confirmation or being incompatible with the newest version of the OS are not likely causes of the issue, since the user would receive an error message or a notification in those cases."

Incremental backups only save the changes made since the last backup, which allows for more frequent backups and minimizes the amount of storage required. This would allow the law firm to retain more than three versions of backups without risking backup failure."
