Remediating the system means removing the ransomware, restoring the data, and fixing the vulnerabilities that allowed the attack. However, this process requires careful analysis, planning, and execution, and it may not be possible if the ransomware is still active and communicating with the attackers. Therefore, the technician should first isolate the system and then proceed with the remediation steps12. ✑ Educating the system user (C) is a preventive measure, but it is not a mitigation step. Educating the system user means raising awareness and providing training on how to avoid ransomware attacks, such as by recognizing phishing emails, avoiding suspicious links or attachments, and updating and patching the system regularly. However, this step will not help if the system is already infected, and it may not be effective if the user is not willing or able to follow the best practices.
