    "question": "A company is recycling old hard drives and wants to quickly reprovision the drives for reuse. Which of the following data destruction methods should the company use?",
    "options": [
      "A. Degaussing",
      "B. Standard formatting",
      "C. Low-level wiping",
      "D. Deleting"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Low-level wiping is the best data destruction method for recycling old hard drives for reuse. Low-level wiping is a process that overwrites every bit of data on a hard drive with zeros or random patterns, making it impossible to recover any data from the drive. Low-level wiping also restores the drive to its factory state, removing any bad sectors or errors that may have accumulated over time. Low-level wiping can be done using specialized software tools or hardware devices that connect to the drive. Degaussing, standard formatting, and deleting are not suitable data destruction methods for recycling old hard drives for reuse. Degaussing is a process that exposes a hard drive to a strong magnetic field, destroying both the data and the drive itself. Degaussing renders the drive unusable for reuse. Standard formatting is a process that erases the data on a hard drive by removing the file system structure, but it does not overwrite the data itself. Standard formatting leaves some data recoverable using forensic tools or software utilities. Deleting is a process that removes the data from a hard drive by marking it as free space, but it does not erase or overwrite the data itself. Deleting leaves most data recoverable using undelete tools or software utilities."

Which of the following items A technician is installing RAM in a new workstation and needs to protect against electrostatic discharge. Which of the following will best resolve this concern?",
    "options": [
      "A. Battery backup",
      "B. Thermal paste",
      "C. ESD strap",
      "D. Consistent power"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "An ESD strap, also known as an antistatic wrist strap, is a device that prevents electrostatic discharge (ESD) from damaging sensitive electronic components such as RAM. ESD is the sudden flow of electricity between two objects with different electrical charges, which can cause permanent damage or malfunction to electronic devices. An ESD strap connects the technician’s wrist to a grounded surface, such as a metal case or a mat, and equalizes the electrical potential between the technician and the device. Battery backup, thermal paste, and consistent power are not devices that can protect against ESD."

    "explanation": "The term that defines the extent of a change is scope. Scope is a measure of the size, scale and boundaries of a project or an activity. Scope defines what is included and excluded in the project or activity, such as goals, requirements, deliverables, tasks and resources. Scope helps determine the feasibility, duration and cost of the project or activity. Scope also helps manage the expectations and needs of the stakeholders involved in the project or activity. Purpose is the reason or objective for doing a project or an activity. Purpose defines why the project or activity is important or necessary, such as solving a problem, meeting a need or achieving a goal. Purpose helps provide direction, motivation and justification for the project or activity. Analysis is the process of examining, evaluating and interpreting data or information related to a project or an activity. Analysis helps identify, understand and prioritize issues, risks, opportunities and solutions for the project or activity.

    "explanation": "Calibrating the phone sensors is a step that can troubleshoot the issue of screen not autorotating on a mobile device. Screen autorotation is a feature that automatically adjusts the screen orientation based on the device’s position and movement. Screen autorotation relies on sensors such as accelerometer and gyroscope to detect the device’s tilt and rotation. Calibrating the phone sensors can help fix any errors or inaccuracies in the sensor readings that may prevent screen autorotation from working properly. Enabling the touch screen, reinstalling the operating system, and replacing the screen are not steps that should be done next to troubleshoot this issue."
