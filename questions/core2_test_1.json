    "options": [
      "A. Image deployment",
      "B. Recovery partition installation",
      "C. Remote network installation",
      "D. Repair installation"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Remote network installation is the best option for configuring a new server that requires a bare-metal installation without installation media on site. A remote network installation is a method of installing an operating system or an application over a network connection, such as LAN, WAN, or Internet. A remote network installation can use various protocols, such as PXE, HTTP, FTP, or SMB, to access the installation files from a server or a cloud service. A remote network installation can also use various tools, such as Windows Deployment Services, Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, or Red Hat Kickstart, to automate and customize the installation process. A remote network installation can save time and resources by eliminating the need for physical media and allowing centralized management of multiple installations. Image deployment, recovery partition installation, and repair installation are not correct answers for this question. Image deployment is a method of installing an operating system or an application by copying a preconfigured image file to a target device. Image deployment requires an existing image file and a compatible device. Recovery partition installation is a method of restoring an operating system or an application from a hidden partition on the hard disk that contains the original factory settings. Recovery partition installation requires an existing recovery partition and a functional hard disk. Repair installation is a method of fixing an operating system or an application that is corrupted or damaged by replacing or repairing the system files without affecting the user data or settings. Repair installation requires an existing operating system or application and a working device. - ✑ Official CompTIA learning resources CompTIA A+ Core 1 and Core 2, page 16 - ✑ CompTIA A+ Complete Study Guide: Core 1 Exam 220-1101 and Core 2 Exam …, page 106"

The new machine automatically receives the IP address of 169.254.0.2 and is unable to communicate with the rest of the network. Which of the following would restore communication?",
    "options": [
      "A. Static entry",
      "B. ARP table",
      "C. APIPA address",
      "D. NTP specification"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "A static entry is the best option to restore communication for the new machine in a small branch office that does not have a DHCP server. A static entry means manually configuring the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server for the network adapter of the machine. A static entry ensures that the machine has a valid and unique IP address that matches the network configuration and can communicate with the rest of the network. The new machine automatically receives the IP address of 169.254.0.2 because it uses APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing), which is a feature that enables computers to self-assign an IP address when a DHCP server is not available. However, APIPA only works for local communication within the same subnet, and does not provide a default gateway or a DNS server. Therefore, the new machine is unable to communicate with the rest of the network, which may be on a different subnet or require a gateway or a DNS server to access. The other options are not related to restoring communication for the new machine. ARP table is a cache that stores the mapping between IP addresses and MAC addresses for the devices on the network.

A developer's Type 2 hypervisor is performing inadequately when compiling new source code. Which of the following components should the developer upgrade to improve the hypervisor’s performance? - A. Amount of system RAM - B. NIC performance - C. Storage IOPS - D. Dedicated GPU Answer: A Explanation: The correct answer is A. Amount of system RAM. A Type 2 hypervisor is a virtualization software that runs on top of a host operating system, which means it shares the system resources with the host OS and other applications. Therefore, increasing the amount of system RAM can improve the performance of the hypervisor and the virtual machines running on it. RAM is used to store data and instructions that are frequently accessed by the CPU, and having more RAM can reduce the need for swapping data to and from the storage device, which is slower than RAM. NIC performance, storage IOPS, and dedicated GPU are not as relevant for improving the hypervisor’s performance in this scenario. NIC performance refers to the speed and quality of the network interface card, which is used to connect the computer to a network. Storage IOPS refers to the number of input/output operations per second that can be performed by the storage device, which is a measure of its speed and efficiency. Dedicated GPU refers to a separate graphics processing unit that can handle complex graphics tasks, such as gaming or video editing. These components may affect other aspects of the computer’s performance, but they are not directly related to the hypervisor’s ability to compile new source code.

Disable the account. - D. Choose a password that never expires. Answer: A This will ensure that the user is the only one who knows their password, and that the new password is secure. The CompTIA A+ Core 2 220-1002 exam covers this topic in the domain 1.4 Given a scenario, use appropriate data destruction and disposal methods. - A. Degaussing - B. Standard formatting - C. Low-level wiping - D. Deleting Answer: C Explanation: Low-level wiping is the best data destruction method for recycling old hard drives for reuse. Low-level wiping is a process that overwrites every bit of data on a hard drive with zeros or random patterns, making it impossible to recover any data from the drive. Low-level wiping also restores the drive to its factory state, removing any bad sectors or errors that may have accumulated over time. Low-level wiping can be done using specialized software tools or hardware devices that connect to the drive. Degaussing, standard formatting, and deleting are not suitable data destruction methods for recycling old hard drives for reuse. Degaussing is a process that exposes a hard drive to a strong magnetic field, destroying both the data and the drive itself. Degaussing renders the drive unusable for reuse. Standard formatting is a process that erases the data on a hard drive by removing the file system structure, but it does not overwrite the data itself. Standard formatting leaves some data recoverable using forensic tools or software utilities. Deleting is a process that removes the data from a hard drive by marking it as free space, but it does not erase or overwrite the data itself. Deleting leaves most data recoverable using undelete tools or software utilities. - ✑ Official CompTIA learning resources CompTIA A+ Core 1 and Core 2, page 15 - ✑ CompTIA A+ Complete Study Guide: Core 1 Exam 220-1101 and Core 2 Exam …, page 105 Which of the following will best resolve this concern? - A. Battery backup - B. Thermal paste - C. ESD strap - D.

Software firewall - B. Password complexity - C. Antivirus application - D. Anti-malware scans A software firewall is a program that monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic on a computer or a server. A software firewall can help prevent unauthorized LAN devices from accessing stored files on a company file server by applying rules and policies that filter the network packets. In order to connect to a user’s laptop via RDP, the technician should open port 3389 on the Windows firewall. This is because RDP uses port 3389 for communication12. The other options are not necessary or relevant for establishing an RDP connection. - Confirming the user can ping the default gateway is not required for RDP, as it only tests the network connectivity between the user’s laptop and the router. RDP works over the internet, so the technician should be able to ping the user’s laptop directly using its IP address3. - Changing the IP address on the user’s laptop is not needed for RDP, as long as the IP address is valid and not conflicting with another device on the network. The user’s laptop has a valid IP address of 192.168.0.45, which belongs to the same subnet as the gateway (192.168.0.1) and the subnet mask (255.255.255.0)4. - Changing the subnet mask on the user’s laptop is not required for RDP, as long as the subnet mask matches the network configuration. The user’s laptop has a correct subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, which defines a network with 254 possible hosts4."

A customer recently experienced a power outage at a SOHO. The customer does not think the components are connected properly. A print job continued running for several minutes after the power failed, but the customer was not able to interact with the computer. Once the UPS stopped beeping, all functioning devices also turned off. In case of a future power failure, the customer wants to have the most time available to save cloud documents and shut down the computer without losing any data. Answer: 60 UPS > Surge protector = Computer, wifi router, cable modem Surge protector = wallOutlet, printer and scanner A Windows workstation that was recently updated with approved system patches shut down instead of restarting. Upon reboot, the technician notices an alert stating the workstation has malware in the root OS folder. The technician promptly performs a System Restore and reboots the workstation, but the malware is still detected. Which of the following BEST describes why the system still has malware? - A. A system patch disabled the antivirus protection and host firewall. - B. The system updates did not include the latest anti-malware definitions. - C. The system restore process was compromised by the malware. - D. The malware was installed before the system restore point was created. Answer: D The best explanation for why the system still has malware after performing a System Restore is that the malware was installed before the system restore point was created. A system restore point is a snapshot of the system settings and configuration at a certain point in time. A System Restore is a feature that allows users to restore their system to a previous state in case of problems or errors. However, a System Restore does not affect personal files or folders, and it may not remove malware that was already present on the system before the restore point was created. A system patch disabling the antivirus protection and host firewall may increase the risk of malware infection, but it does not explain why the malware persists after a System Restore. The system updates not including the latest anti-malware definitions may reduce the effectiveness of malware detection and removal, but it does not explain why the malware persists after a System Restore. The system restore process being compromised by the malware may prevent a successful System Restore, but it does not explain why the malware persists after a System Restore. A technician is unable to completely start up a system. The OS freezes when the desktop background appears, and the issue persists when the system is restarted.

Answer: B Explanation: The most likely reason that the system is not utilizing all the available RAM is that it is running a 32-bit OS. A 32-bit OS can only address up to 4GB of RAM, and some of that is reserved for hardware and system use. Therefore, even if the technician installed 8GB of RAM, the system can only use around 3.5GB of usable RAM. To use the full 8GB of RAM, the technician would need to install a 64-bit OS, which can address much more memory. The system missing updates, the system’s memory failing, or the system requiring BIOS updates are not likely to cause this issue. A user reports a PC is running slowly. The technician suspects it has a badly fragmented hard drive. Which of the following tools should the technician use? - A. resmon.exe - B. msconfig.extf - C. dfrgui.exe - D. msmfo32.exe Answer: C Explanation: The technician should use dfrgui.exe to defragment the hard drive. A Linux technician needs a filesystem type that meets the following requirements: - All changes are tracked. - The possibility of file corruption is reduced. - Data recovery is easy. Which of the following filesystem types best meets these requirements? - A. ext3 - B. FAT32 - C. exFAT - D. NTFS Answer: A Explanation: The ext3 file system is a Linux native file system that meets the requirements of the question. It has the following features: - All changes are tracked. The ext3 file system uses a journaling mechanism that records all changes to the file system metadata in a special log called the journal before applying them to the actual file system. This ensures that the file system can be restored to a consistent state in case of a power failure or system crash. - The possibility of file corruption is reduced. The journaling feature of ext3 also... reduces the possibility of file corruption, as it avoids the need for a full file system check after an unclean shutdown. The file system can be quickly replayed from the journal and any inconsistencies can be fixed12. ✑ Data recovery is easy. The ext3 file system supports undeletion of files using tools such as ext3grep or extundelete, which can scan the file system for deleted inodes and attempt to recover the data blocks associated with them34. 1: Introduction to Linux File System [Structure and Types] - MiniTool1 2: 7 Ways to Determine the File System Type in Linux (Ext2, Ext3 or Ext4) - Tecmint3 3: How to Recover Deleted Files in Linux with ext3grep4 4: How to Recover Deleted Files from ext3 Partitions A remote user is experiencing issues connecting to a corporate email account on a laptop. The user clicks the internet connection icon and does not recognize the connected Wi-Fi. The help desk technician, who is troubleshooting the issue, assumes this is a rogue access point. Which of the following is the first action the technician should take? - A. Restart the wireless adapter. - B. Launch the browser to see if it redirects to an unknown site. - C. Instruct the user to disconnect the Wi-Fi. - D. Instruct the user to run the installed antivirus software. Answer: C Explanation: Instructing the user to disconnect the Wi-Fi is the first action the technician should take if they suspect a rogue access point. A rogue access point is an unauthorized wireless network that could be used to intercept or manipulate network traffic, compromise security, or launch attacks. Disconnecting the Wi-Fi would prevent further exposure or damage to the user’s device or data. Restarting the wireless adapter, launching the browser, or running the antivirus software are possible actions to take after disconnecting the Wi-Fi, but they are not as urgent or effective as the first step. ✑ Official CompTIA learning resources CompTIA A+ Core 1 and Core 2, page 22 ✑ CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1101) and Core 2 (220-1102) Cert Guide, page 456 A user is unable to access files on a work PC after opening a text document.

A developer receives the following error while trying to install virtualization software on a workstation: VTx not supported by system Which of the following upgrades will MOST likely fix the issue? - A. Processor - B. Hard drive - C. Memory - D. Video card Answer: A Explanation: The processor is the component that determines if the system supports virtualization technology (VTx), which is required for running virtualization software. The hard drive, memory and video card are not directly related to VTx support, although they may affect the performance of the virtual machines. Verified References: https://www.comptia.org/blog/what-is-virtualization https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a A company recently experienced a security incident in which a USB drive containing malicious software was able to covertly install malware on a workstation. Which of the following actions should be taken to prevent this incident from happening again? (Select two). - A. Install a host-based IDS. - B. Restrict log-in times. - C. Enable a BIOS password. - D. Update the password complexity. - E. Disable AutoRun. - F. Update the antivirus definitions. - G. Restrict user permissions. Answer: E, G Explanation: AutoRun is a feature of Windows that automatically executes a program or file when a removable media such as a USB drive is inserted into the computer. Disabling AutoRun can prevent a USB drive containing malicious software from covertly installing malware on a workstation, as it would require the user to manually open the drive and run the file. Restricting user permissions can also prevent a USB drive containing malicious software from covertly installing malware on a workstation, as it would limit the user permissions. user’s ability to execute or install unauthorized programs or files. Installing a host-based IDS, restricting log-in times, enabling a BIOS password, updating the password complexity, and updating the antivirus definitions are not actions that can directly prevent this incident from happening again. An employee has repeatedly contacted a technician about malware infecting a work computer. The technician has removed the malware several times, but the user's PC keeps getting infected. Which of the following should the technician do to reduce the risk of future infections? - A. Configure the firewall. - B. Restore the system from backups. - C. Educate the end user - D. Update the antivirus program. Answer: C Explanation: Malware is software that infects computer systems to damage, disable or exploit the computer or network for various malicious purposes5. Malware is typically distributed via email attachments, fake internet ads, infected applications or websites, and often relies on user interaction to execute6. Therefore, one of the most effective ways to prevent malware infections is to educate the end user about the common signs and sources of malware, and how to avoid them7. Configuring the firewall, restoring the system from backups, and updating the antivirus program are also important security measures, but they do not address the root cause of the user’s repeated infections, which is likely due to a lack of awareness or caution. - 5: Malware: what it is, how it works, and how to stop it - Norton - 6: How to Prevent Malware: 15 Best Practices for Malware Prevention - 7: 10 Security Tips for How to Prevent Malware Infections - Netwrix After a failed update, an application no longer launches and generates the following error message: Application needs to be repaired.

The original HDMI monitor is mounted to the left of the new monitor. When moving the mouse to the right from the original monitor to the new monitor, the mouse stops at the end of the screen on the original monitor. Which of the following will allow the mouse to correctly move to the new monitor? - A. Rearranging the monitor's position in display settings - B. Swapping the cables for the monitors - C. Using the Ctrl+AIt+> to correct the display orientation - D. Updating the display drivers for the video card Answer: B Explanation: The correct answer is B. Swapping the cables for the monitors. When the second monitor is connected with the HDMI port, it is necessary to swap the cables for the monitors so that the mouse can move from the original monitor to the new monitor. This is because the HDMI port is designed to only support one monitor, and the mouse will not be able to move from one to the other without the cables being swapped. According to CompTIA A+ Core 2 documents, \"When connecting multiple displays to a system, the cables used to connect the displays must be swapped between the displays. For example, if a monitor is connected to a system using a VGA cable, the VGA cable must be moved to the next display to allow the mouse to move between the two displays.\" A technician is familiar with most personnel at a customer's location and has clearance to work unsupervised.
