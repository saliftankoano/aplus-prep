A warranty is a guarantee from the vendor that covers the repair or replacement of defective or faulty products within a specified period of time. Verifying warranty status with the vendor can help the technician determine if the motherboard is eligible for warranty service and what steps to take to obtain it. Escalating the issue to Tier 2, replacing the motherboard, and purchasing another PC are not the most logical next steps in the remediation process."

    "explanation": "When a homeowner moves and sets up a new router for the new ISP it is important to take appropriate security measures to protect their network from potential security threats. The FIRST step that the homeowner should take after installation of all relevant cabling and hardware is to change the default passwords on new network devices. Most modern routers come with default usernames and passwords that are widely known to potential attackers. If these defaults are not changed, it could make it easier for external attackers to gain unauthorized access to the network. Changing the passwords on new network devices is a simple but effective way to improve the security posture of the network."

RDP is a protocol that allows a user to connect to another computer over a network and use its graphical interface. RDP is commonly used for remote desktop software, such as Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection. To use RDP, the user’s computer must run RDP server software, and the technician must run RDP client software.

BitLocker is a feature of Windows that encrypts the entire drive to protect data from unauthorized access. If a technician is trying to repair a Windows 10 OS that has BitLocker enabled, they will need the recovery key to access the drive and continue the OS repair.
