      "A. Battery backup",
      "B. Electrostatic discharge mat",
      "C. Proper ventilation",
      "D. Green disposal"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Proper ventilation is a factor that can extend the life of a device by preventing overheating and thermal damage to the device’s components. Proper ventilation means ensuring that there is enough airflow around and inside the device to dissipate heat and maintain a suitable temperature for optimal performance. Proper ventilation can be achieved by using fans, heat sinks, vents, or liquid cooling systems, as well as avoiding placing the device near heat sources or in enclosed spaces. Battery backup, electrostatic discharge mat, and green disposal are not factors that can extend the life of a device."

    "explanation": "Shoulder surfing is a threat that involves someone looking over another person’s shoulder to observe their screen, keyboard, or other sensitive information. Shoulder surfing can be used to steal passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), credit card numbers, or other confidential data. The use of a privacy screen on a computer can help prevent shoulder surfing by limiting the viewing angle of the screen and making it harder for someone to see the screen from the side or behind. Impersonation, whaling, and tailgating are not threats that can be prevented by using a privacy screen on a computer."

    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "A technician needs to reimage a desktop in an area without network access, which means that the technician cannot use network-based methods such as PXE or SMB to deploy the image. Therefore, the technician should use offline methods that involve removable media such as USB or optical media. USB and optical media are common ways to store and transfer system images, and they can be used to boot the desktop and initiate the reimaging process. The technician will need to create a bootable USB or optical media that contains the system image and the imaging software, and then insert it into the desktop and change the boot order in the BIOS or UEFI settings. The technician can then follow the instructions on the screen to reimage the desktop."

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The ifconfig command is a tool for configuring network interfaces that any Linux system administrator should know. It is used to bring interfaces up or down, assign and remove addresses and routes, manage ARP cache, and much more. One of the information that ifconfig can display is the MAC address of each network interface, which is a unique identifier of the physical layer of the network device. The MAC address is usually shown as a hexadecimal string separated by colons, such as 00:0c:29:3f:5c:1f. To get the MAC address of a Linux distribution, a technician can use the ifconfig command without any arguments, which will show the details of all the active network interfaces, or specify the name of a particular interface, such as eth0 or wlan0, to show only the details of that interface."

    "explanation": "WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access version 3) is the latest version of Wi-Fi security and offers the highest level of protection available. It is designed to protect against brute force password attempts and protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. WPA3 also supports the use of stronger encryption algorithms, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which provides additional protection for wireless networks.

This can be exploited by malware authors who place malicious files on flash drives that execute automatically when inserted into a computer. Turning off AutoPlay can prevent this type of incident by requiring the user to manually open or run files from removable media devices. Disabling UAC (user account control), restricting local administrators and enabling UPnP (universal plug and play) are not effective ways to prevent this type of incident."
